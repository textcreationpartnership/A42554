            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Theſe pleaſures put out the eye of reaſon, and ſmother all the ſeeds of Wiſdom and Vertue in man, the which they effect more powerfully, when they are moſt violent: wherefore a wiſe man was wont to ſay, that he had rather fall into frenzy, than ſuffer himſelf to be ſurprized with

Some again have made bleſſedneſs to conſiſt in Honours, Dignities, Superiorities, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Acclamations, and all ſorts of preferments; but happineſs conſiſteth not in theſe things; theſe are all very empty things: a bladder when it is blown, ſeems to be full, when it hath nothing in it but a little thin air, a ſmall pin is ſufficient to pierce it, and empty it of all that is in it: ſo it is with thoſe that love popularity and the praiſe of men more than the praiſe of God, and receive honour from men, themſelves in the mean time being ſtrangers to God: many of them ſeem to be full, but they are but as bladders full of wind, full of vanity; a ſlight occaſion is enough to empty them of all their happineſs.</p>
            <p>Others would have it conſiſt in wealth and riches: So <hi>Antiſthenes</hi> ſaid, that he onely was happy, that died in the affluence of worldly proſperity: but when a man expecteth happineſs and ſatisfaction from theſe things, he findeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, he made him great works, builded houſes, planted Vine-yards, got him Servants and Maidens, and had great poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of great and ſmall Cattel, above all that were in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> before him, that he gathered to him Silver and Gold, and the peculiar treaſure
<pb facs="tcp:52862:4"/> of Kings, and of the Provinces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo he became great, and increaſed more than all that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2. from <hi>v.</hi> 4. to 11. Now <hi>v.</hi> 11. he looks back on all the work and labour of his hands, and behold all was vanity and vexation of ſpirit, and <hi>ver.</hi> 17. he hated life it ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the work that was wrought under the Sun was grievous to him; and <hi>ver.</hi> 18. he hated all his labour which he had taken under the Sun: therefore theſe things were far from giving him ſound contentment; they did rather increaſe the Diſeaſe, and make the Soul more reſtleſs than before. Now if ſuch a one as <hi>Solomon,</hi> that had intereſt in God, did thus far loſe that ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent he had in God by an eager purſuit of theſe periſhing things, then much more impoſſible is it, that the ſoul that never had intereſt in God, ſhould find happineſs and contentment in the creature: it is impoſſible for thoſe that neglect the fountain of living waters, to quench their thirſt at a broken ciſtern; nor can man be made happy by any thing inferiour to himſelf: now all earthly creatures are inferiour to the reaſonable ſoul of man, and the ſubſtance and faculties thereof doth far ſurpaſs all the riches and honours of the world; and if man cannot find ſound contentment and true happineſs in himſelf, it will be in vain to ſeek it in theſe things.</p>
            <p>Others there were (that came neareſt to the point) that would have bleſſedneſs to conſiſt in
<pb facs="tcp:52862:4"/> vertue; and yet alas! there were none, even of the wiſer Heathens, that ever knew what true vertue meant; and conſequently what true bleſſedneſs meant. They wrote much of ſome that were excellent among them, men renowned and famous for vertue: it was ſaid of <hi>Cato,</hi> that he was vertues true image, <hi>Qui nunquam recte fecit, ut facere videretur, ſed quia aliter facere non potuit;</hi> who never did any thing well that he might ſeem to do it, but becauſe he could not do otherwiſe: it was alſo ſaid of him, that he was <hi>ſuae fortunae Faber;</hi> let him live in any time or common-wealth, he would make ſhift for one: of <hi>Fabritius</hi> it is all ſpoken, that you might ſooner have turn'd the Sun out of his courſe, than him from his integrity and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Yet the beſt of them were but guilded pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſherds, and the faireſt vertues they talkt of were but painted rags; they never knew what God or Chriſt was, what Heaven or Hell were. Bleſſedneſs is a thing that every man hath in his eye, it is the mark that every one ſhoots at, a thing that every man deſireth: bleſſedneſs is that eſtate that every man co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veteth <hi>&amp; boni &amp; mali,</hi> both good and bad men, ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Auguſt.</hi> in Pſal. 119. Serm. 1.</note> Good men do therefore labour to be good, yet that is no wonder; but even wicked men alſo do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore labour to be wicked, that they may be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; there is ſome appearance of good in it unto them, they aim at a kind of bleſſedneſs even in
<pb facs="tcp:52862:5"/> the purſuit of wickedneſs; and many there are that have Heaven and happineſs at their tongues end, that have the earth continually at their fingers end.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>O curas hominum! O quantum eſt in rebus inane!</hi>
            </q>
            <q>
               <l>Alas! Mans cares, how full of pain?</l>
               <l>Alas! Mans wayes, how vile and vain?</l>
            </q>
            <p>But though bleſſedneſs be in every man's heart, yet many men are ſtrangers to it: Many things are ſubject to the eye; but of bleſſedneſs we may ſay, eye hath not ſeen it: other comforts and good things are taken in by the ear; but we may ſay of bleſſedneſs, ear hath not heard it, nor is it poſſible to enter into the heart of man to conceive, how great that good is that is compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p>The bleſſed man is defined by ſome to be one, <hi>Qui habet omnia quae vult, &amp; nihil patitur quae non vult;</hi> that hath every thing he would have, and ſuffereth nothing he would not ſuffer: ſo that it is an eſtate to be conſidered privatively and poſitively: <hi>Privatively,</hi> in reſpect of what muſt be wanting; <hi>Poſitively,</hi> in reſpect of what muſt be had. 1. There muſt be an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all that is evil, whatſoever is in any degree evil, or whatſoever a man in his own underſtanding doth apprehend to be evil, or conceit to be evil, that he muſt want, and be without: for if there be any evil at all that he
<pb facs="tcp:52862:5"/> either feels or feareth, ſo long as he is in that eſtate he cannot be in a bleſſed eſtate; yea though it be but an imaginary evil; his own fears, imaginations and apprehenſions are to him a kind of unhappineſs: while man is under the apprehenſion, fear or imagination of any evil, he is vexed, diſquieted, tormented, and cannot be truly happy. 2. On the other ſide as there muſt be an abſence of all that is evil, ſo there muſt be an affluence of whatſoever things are good: every good thing the heart can wiſh, a man muſt enjoy: for look how much of any good thing he wanteth, ſo much of his bleſſedneſs he wanteth. Therefore the word in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> that ſignifies bleſſedneſs is a plurall word,<note place="margin">

               </note> and never found in the ſingular number: Some give this reaſon for it, becauſe it is not <hi>hoc aut illud, unum aut aliud;</hi> it is not this or that, one or the other good thing that can make a man's eſtate bleſſed: but he that will be in a bleſſed eſtate muſt <hi>omnibus bonis affluere,</hi> abound with all good things, and no good that he can deſire muſt be wanting to him. Bleſſedneſs is the enjoyment of good correſpondent to all the deſires of a Chriſtian, it is both the firſt and laſt good of a Chriſtian, the firſt and laſt of things to be deſired; the firſt for excellency, the laſt for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment; it is the ſpring of all good; when bleſſedneſs cometh, all good cometh along with it; it comprehendeth all good whatſoever: Moreover, bleſſedneſs is the Crown and remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
<pb facs="tcp:52862:6"/> of all good; though God doth endue men with ſeveral gifts and graces, and albeit as there are ſeveral gifts and employments of men, ſo there ſhall be ſeveral rewards; yet the reward of all is but one bleſſedneſs. And hereunto I will add one thing more, <hi>viz.</hi> that bleſſedneſs hath ever perpetuity annexed to it; and that ſame perpetuity of happineſs addeth all in all to the perfection of it;<note place="margin">Non eſt iſta beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudo, de cujus aeternitate dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatur.</note> for there is no perfection of felicity, where there is no aſſurance of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity; which perpetuity doth neither depend upon the nature of the thing it ſelf, nor proceed from any natural neceſſity, that our ſouls ſhould ſo exerciſe themſelves for ever in beholding and loving God; but from the will of God which doth freely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect our nature in ſo high a degree, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it ſo perfected.</p>
            <p>From hence this concluſion will follow, that the bleſſed eſtate being ſuch an eſtate as we have ſpoken of, it is not to be attained in this life. The bleſſedneſs of man in this life is but like the girding on of the Sword be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fighting of the Battel; till the battel be fought the victory cannot be judged, nor the Crown given. Alas! in this life there are many good things wanting to us that our Souls do deſire, many evils preſent with us from which we would fain be delivered: we have now health, and anon ſickneſs; now plenty, anon
<pb facs="tcp:52862:6"/> want; now peace, anon trouble; but in Heaven there is all joy and no ſorrow: in the world there are reciprocal viciſſitudes of joy and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: joy and ſorrow be as it were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchanging ſails of the worlds wind-mill, it is therefore the hand of death that muſt open the door for us to an happy life, according to that of the Poet.</p>

            <p>How ſhould the conſideration hereof wean us from the love of this life? why ſhould our love be there ſet, where no bleſſedneſs is to be had? the things of this life are of that nature, <hi>Quae poſſeſſa onerant, amata inquinant, amiſſa cruciant;</hi> as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaketh; things, which while we poſſeſs, they burthen us; while we love, they defile us; when we foregoe, they torment us; and therefore better a great deal that we honourably contemn, what we cannot but ſorrowfully loſe: bleſſedneſs is not to be attained on earth, but to be hoped for in Heaven; and this ſhould ſtir us up to the ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after a better life, for that condition where we may be bleſſed for ever.</p>
            <p>The fruition of eternal glory is a future good, there is difficulty to attain it; it is no eaſie entrance into Heaven; God hath made <hi>viam lacteam in coelis,</hi> not <hi>ad coelum;</hi> God hath made a milky way in Heaven paved with ſtars, but not to Heaven; no, the way to Heaven is paved with ſundry difficulties; the way is narrow, the gate is ſtrait, many ſeek and cannot find it: Yet although Heaven be difficult to obtain, there is a fair poſſibility for any man to win the crown of eternal glory: There was never a Saint that lived and fought this Chriſtian warfare, but when they had finiſhed their courſe, they received Palmes, the Enſign of triumph, and the Crown of righteouſneſs which Chriſt the righteous Judge
<pb facs="tcp:52862:7"/> hath laid up for them. <hi>Laertius</hi> writeth of one that had been thirty and three years travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſeek out the natures of Bees: indeed Bees are excellent creatures, and there is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent uſe of the honey that they make; but here is that which is ſweeter than Honey and the Honey-comb: they that take pains for temporal things, it is not bread that they labour for, it is not that which will ſatisfie; now if it bring no ſatisfaction with it, it can bring no bleſſedneſs with it; but everlaſting glory and bleſſedneſs is the bread that will ſatisfie; this will be as marrow and fatneſs to our ſouls; let us labour for this, and our ſoul ſhall live.</p>

            <p>I have written this Tract of the glory of Heaven and of eternal bleſſedneſs (which I humbly dedicate to you) partly that I might feed my own mind with this Heavenly contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and partly that I might ſtir you up to the more ſerious conſideration of the ſame things: there is nothing will make us more contemn the world, and kindle in us an earneſt deſire and longing after Heaven, than the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and diligent meditation on the glory of Heaven, and the bleſſedneſs of the Saints in the world to come will do: Oh did we fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently conſider what pure and unmixt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb facs="tcp:52862:8"/> and Gardens of Spices, that are alwayes green and flouriſhing, how ſhould we rouze up our ſelves, and ſay, what do we here? Oh why do we weary our ſelves like the bird that toileth to gather a few ſticks together to build a neſt in the ſpring time, which after a little time will be pulled down and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken? Remember I beſeech you, that bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not to be had here, but in Heaven; in Heaven where life eternal is, there, and there only, true and perfect bleſſedneſs is; as this enſuing Treatiſe will fully demonſtrate.</p>
            <p>Therefore let no temptation of Satan at any time overcome you; let not the love of any ſin poſſeſs you, let no evil example of the world ſeduce you, let no evil advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages or pleaſures ſteal away your heart from you: go on ſtill in making you friends of the unrighteous <hi>Mammon,</hi> and great profit ſhall thereby come unto you.

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> Homil. in Luc. 16.</note>) that God made the rich for the profit of the poor, but the poor for the profit of the rich, when they make them friends of the riches of iniquity: as if rich men ſhould one day find that the poor were their beſt friends; for when they come to be received into everlaſting habitations, God ſeems to make his poor Saints the Porters of Heaven. God will then remember all the kindneſſes you have ſhewed to any of his
<pb facs="tcp:52862:8"/> diſtreſſed ſervants, and abundantly reward them; yea he will recompenſe a cup of cold water given to a Diſciple of Chriſt in the name of a Diſciple, with the whole fountain of the water of life; and two mites, with the whole treaſure in the Temple: there for Gold you ſhall have Glory; for earthly Mannours, heavenly Manſions; for Silver that periſheth, ſolace without end; Mirth without meaſure, pleaſure without pain; there you ſhall be clothed in white, which is the innocence of the Saints; have palmes in your hands, in token of victory; and be Crowned with a Diadem of pure Gold, which is immortality: your happineſs then will be for God to make you of his Court, though here you are not of his Council.</p>
            <p>Finally, let me excite you to raiſe your thoughts and meditations beyond theſe ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary things, and lift them up to thoſe that are above, ſettle your affections upon them, exerciſe your ſtudy in them, feed your deſires and hopes with them; and ever think of one thing, that all the Kingdoms in the world are not to be compared with the pooreſt Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in Heaven; there onely is the centre and ſeat of bleſſedneſs, for there (as an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſaith) <hi>Quicquid amabitur, aderit,</hi>

Be your afflictions never ſo many, be they as great, as grievous as can be imagined and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, yet the glory which ſhall be revealed in you, is far greater then all your ſufferings.</p>

                     </gap> properly, doth note unto us that high eſteem which any have of ſome ſpecial worth and excellency in others, or of ſome notable acts wrought by others. So the glory of God, is that high eſteem and account which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52862:17"/> men and Angels do in their apprehenſions en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain of the excellency, majeſty, goodneſs, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, perfection, and al-ſufficiency of God; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that which the Saints and Angels do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of him, whoſe apprehenſion of Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and infinite perfection is mixt with an entire love of God. When we diſcern a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial excellency in a perſon whom we entirely love, this will enlarge our apprehenſions in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the excellency of ſuch a perſon. He that loveth the Lord ſincerely, will ſee more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious excellencies then another; yet even the enemies of God cannot ſo ſhut their eyes, but that many of them, even againſt their wills, ſhall have a glorious eſteem of the Lords excellency.<note place="margin">Exod. 9.27.</note> 
                     <hi>Pharaoh</hi> could not but diſcern a glorious excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of power and Juſtice in the Lord, when he ſaw his hand ſo heavy, and his ſtroakes ſo multiplyed upon him and his people. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of their Spirits againſt the Lord doth ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe the brightneſs of the glory of God ſhining unto them, but yet it cannot altogether darken it.

                     </gap> cannot hinder, but that the glory of God's Power, Wiſdom, and Juſtice, ſhall appear to the Devil himſelf; and he ſhall be forced to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an high eſteem of his excellency and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, although there doth not one glimps of his love and favour ſhine there. So the glory of the Saints <hi>(properly)</hi> is that high eſteem which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52862:17"/> others have of the excellency which God hath put upon them, and of the graces of God ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them.</p>
                  <p>But I take it, it is more often uſed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for ſuch glorious excellencies, as do deſerve or cauſe ſuch an high eſteem of thoſe in whom they are. So of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> it is ſaid, That he ſaw the glory of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.25. That is, a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious brightneſs, and repreſentation of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, which could not but cauſe an high and glorious eſteem of ſo excellent a Majeſty in all beholders. There are glorious excellencies which God in this life hath begun in his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: in which ſence glory is taken for the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of that which is properly called glory, for that which produceth glory, or cauſeth an high eſteem in the hearts and minds of others: ſo that this is glory radically, whereas an high eſteem following hereupon is glory formally and properly.</p>
                  <p>Now then take glory in this ſenſe for any glorious excellencies in any perſon, we muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh a main and mighty difference between the fullneſs of glorious excellency which is origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in the Creatour, and that degree of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious excellency which is derived to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. His glory is his own; the glory of the Creatures is not their own, but borrowed, it is the glory of God ſhining in them. Now this glory which the God of all glory hath put upon the Creatures is of divers kinds, as we may learn
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52862:18"/> from the Apoſtles words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.40, 41. <hi>The glory of the Celeſtial is one, and the glory of the Terreſtial is another. There is one glory of the Sun, and another glory of the Moon, and another of the Stars; for one Star differeth from another in glory.</hi> So there is a glory in unreaſonable, and a glory in reaſonable and intellectual Creatures.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In unreaſonable: there is a glorious excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, ſplendor, and brightneſs put upon the Sun, Moon, and Stars, as in that former place. The very Flowers of the Field have ſome glimpſe of glory put upon them. <hi>Behold the Lillies of the Field,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>I ſay unto you, that even</hi> Solomon <hi>in all his glory, was not clothed like one of them, Matth.</hi> 6. There was more glory in the native beauty of a Lilly, than in all the luſtre which art and coſt was able to weave into King <hi>Solomon</hi>'s rich and royal Robes. So thoſe paſſages, <hi>Job.</hi> 39.19, 20. which the Lord uttered with his own mouth for <hi>Job</hi>'s conviction and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, do ſerve to ſhew ſome degrees of glory and excellency, wherewith the Lord had adorn'd and beautified divers of the bruit Creatures; as among others, the Horſe; where ye muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that he ſpeaks of a prime one for ſhape and ſpirit. <hi>Hast thou given the Horſe ſtrength? haſt thou clothed his neck with Thunder? canst thou make him afraid, as a Graſhopper?

Such eminency was in <hi>Saul, Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar, Alexander</hi> the Great, <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> and theſe things made them glorious in a degree. But as the Apoſtle ſaith in another caſe, the glory of the Terreſtrial is one, the glory of the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial is another; ſo all this is but Terreſtrial glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: it is Spiritual and Celeſtial glory which here we are to ſpeak of; a ſpecial eminency and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious excellency in ſpiritual and heavenly things
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52862:19"/> beſtowed upon the Children of God; and theſe are imperfect in this world, and fully perfected and conſummated in the world to come.</p>
                  <p>Glory (to ſpeak properly of that which is to come) I rather conceive to be the general, comprehending holineſs it ſelf, and all other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of this glorious eſtate and condition, then a part or member diſtinguiſhed from it: for that perfection of holineſs which the Saints ſhall then enjoy, ſhall be exceeding glorious: but thus I ſpeak according to our uſual manner of expreſſing theſe things. The glory of the Saints in Heaven is that which accompliſheth that which grace hath begun, and ſetteth a Seale upon the fullneſs of all our felicities. <hi>Glory</hi> (as one well obſerveth) implieth ſome great eminency and excellency,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Sibs.</hi>

Chriſt was inwardly glorious while he was upon earth, in the ſtate of abaſement he had true glory as he was God and man, but there was not a manifeſtation of it till he was received up into glory; therefore the glory of the Saints is called the manifeſtation of the Sons of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.19. Glory alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth victory over all oppoſition: here God's children are ſubject to abaſement, to ſhame, to ſufferings in divers kinds: but glory will exempt them from all baſeneſs, and all that may diminiſh

The firſt man (ſaith he in another place) received in Paradiſe a liberty void of all ſervitude; God preſented him with fire and water, and gave him leave to chuſe: man took fire, and rejected the water: God who is juſt, let him graſp what he had choſen; ſo that he was therefore unhappy, becauſe he would be ſo: Man was left in a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to ſtain his honour, and loſe his glory: he did not long abide in that honour. <hi>Adam</hi> fell (as is probable) the ſame day he was created:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe Chriſt ſaith of the Devil, he was a murtherer from the beginning, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. His malicious mind being ſuch toward them that ſtood (himſelf being fallen) that he could not endure to ſee them in that eſtate, no not for an hour. 2. If he had continued one day or one night in his integrity, the bleſſing of God upon his Marriage would have taken place, and ſo he would have begotten children without ſin, which ſith he did not, but begat Children in his own
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52862:21"/> Image, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.3. It's likely he fell the ſame day wherein he was Created. 3. See the Anſwer that <hi>Eve</hi> makes to the Devil, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.2. <hi>We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the Garden,</hi> i. e. Have free liberty to eat, ſignifying that as yet they had not eaten, and therefore it could be no long time. But the Saints at the laſt day ſhall be raiſed to ſuch a ſtate of glory and honour, as ſhall never fade, their Crown and Garland ſhall never wither: fading glory is very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, it is like a flaſh of lightning. <hi>Adam</hi> was tempted and loſt his preſent Glory, his dignity was ſoon gone; but the Glory that God will put upon his Saints ſhall be like the fixed Stars ſhining in the Kingdom of the Father; they ſhall be like unto Chriſt, whoſe Glory is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: this is the greateſt and laſt benefit they ſhall receive by Chriſt, far greater then <hi>Adam</hi>'s in his ſtate of innocence.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. that is, like him in glory. Now, when I ſay the Saints ſhall be like unto Chriſt, you muſt conſider, that there is a great difference between likeneſs and equality. Things may be like each other, which may be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal; Water in a Diſh, is like the Water in the River, but very unequal to it: An Infant in the day of his Birth, may be like the Parents, but not equal to them. <hi>Adam</hi> was made in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Maker, but when he ſought to be his equal, it was his ruine. So great is the difference
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52862:21"/> between likeneſs and equality, that the former the Lord gave him freely; but his affecting and ſeeking the latter, was ſo diſpleaſing to the Lord, that he deprived him of the former alſo: ſo that whereas being like to God, he ſought to be equal alſo; he became neither equal to him, nor like him, but contrary to him. So in this caſe, the faithful ſhall be like to Chriſt, but not his equals; as the Stars are in ſome degree like the Sun, but not equal in glory and brightneſs. Now,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt being God and Man, having two Natures united into one Perſon, each Nature hath a peculiar glory. The Divine Nature being infinite, incomprehenſible, eternal, the glory of Chriſt is his very Nature; it is infinite, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible, and eternal glory; it is called <hi>light inacceſſible.</hi> The Humane Nature of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a finite being, the glory thereof is but finite; this glory was given him by his Father; God raiſed him from the dead, and gave him glory, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. Our Natures being the ſame with his Humane Nature, we ſhall be like him in this glory, our Natures being capable of the ſame glory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Yet although the glory of Chriſt's Humane Nature be but (as his Nature) finite, yet this glory doth above all meaſure exceed all the glory of all the Angels and glorified Saints. All the glory of Saints and Angels compared to Chriſt's glory, is no more then all the light of the Stars compared to the light of the Sun. The Moon
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52862:22"/> exceeds the other Stars in light, but the Sun a thouſand times exceeds the Moon, and all the Stars; and if the Sun be wanting, it will be night for all the Stars. So one Saint may excel another in glory, and the Angels may excel the Saints, but yet the glory of the Humane Nature of Chriſt doth a thouſand times exceed the glory of Angels and Saints. One reaſon is, becauſe the Humane Nature of Chriſt is more nearly united to the Divine, then Angels and Men; the nearer union, the greater participation of glory; and can there be a nearer union then a perſonal union? ſuch an union is the union between the Humane Nature and the Divine in Chriſt. If a Body that is capable of the light, ſhould be united into one ſubſtance with the Sun, that Body muſt needs ſhine more glorious then the diſtant Stars. The Humane Nature is united to the incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible glorious Nature and Eſſence, and therefore far more glorious then all other.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, that which is the meaſure of things,<note place="margin">Quod eſt primum in unequoque gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, eſt menſura reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quorum.</note> muſt needs be the chief of all thoſe things of which it is the meaſure; that which is the firſt and chief in every kind, is the meaſure of the reſt. Now the glory of the Humane Nature of Chriſt being the meaſure of our glory, muſt needs excel in glory. The Sun being the meaſure of all the Starry light, and all the Stars borrowing their light from him, muſt needs excel the leſſer Stars
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52862:22"/> in light. Our glory is but a borrowed light: it is of his fullneſs, of his grace and glory, that we receive grace and glory: his human Nature is a vaſt Ciſtern full of glory, and our Natures are but the ſmaller veſſels receiving glory flowing from this vaſt Ciſtern.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Therefore when the Apoſtle ſaith, we ſhall be like to Chriſt, it is meant, <hi>ſecundum proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, non ſecundum aequalitatem:</hi> our glory ſhall be proportionable to his, we ſhall not equal him in glory: it is meant, <hi>quoad partes, non quoad gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus:</hi> we ſhall have the ſame glory for ſubſtance, though not the ſame in degrees. Chriſt ſhall ſo far excel the biggeſt Veſſel of glory, as <hi>Job</hi> in his glorious eſtate did excel himſelf when he lay upon the Dunghil full of naſty ſores; as <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his glory did excel himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Mothers Womb.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Saints ſhall be like Chriſt in glory; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding one Saint will exceed another in glory. God will cloath all his Children alike, yet their garments ſhall be made proportionable for their ſtature. All the Saints ſhall be veſſels of Mercy, yet one Saint ſhall be a larger and more capacious veſſel then another. Chriſt in his anſwer to that curious requeſt of <hi>Zebedees</hi> Wife, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.23. implyeth, that there ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of glory, and granteth, that ſome ſhall ſit at his right hand, ſome at his left hand in his Kingdom. They ſhall all have the ſame glory and happineſs, <hi>ratione objecti faelicitatis &amp; gloriae,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52862:23"/> non ratione participationis,</hi> in reſpect of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of glory and bleſſedneſs, but not in reſpect of participation. God in Chriſt is the object of happineſs, but in regard of participation of the object, one may and ſhall ſee more clearly then another. <hi>In my Father's houſe are many Manſions,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 14.2. <hi>Patris domus,</hi> is put for one and the ſame object of glory, ſaith <hi>Aquinas: Pluralitas manſionum,</hi> the many Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſheweth, there are divers degrees of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And this is his compariſon: there is but one Centre unto which all things tend, but ſome bodies are nearer to the Centre then other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are. So God in Chriſt is the Centre of all our happineſs: <hi>Seneca</hi> calleth God, <hi>Animae Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum,</hi> the Centre of the Soul: but one Saint tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more near to God then another.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Yet notwithſtanding, all the Saints ſhall be full of glory and happineſs, as Chriſt Jeſus is. Chriſt will give to every Saint his meaſure of glory. <hi>Danaeus</hi> ſaith well, that there be two things that the bleſſed Saints want in Heaven; <hi>Carent omni invidia, &amp; carent omni rerum ad beatitudinem neceſſariarum indigentia.</hi> They want envy: one Saint doth not envy another Saint's greater meaſure of glory, becauſe they ſhall be all full of glory: and then there is no want of any thing, for whatſoever pertaineth to make a Creature happy, every Saint ſhall enjoy, and ſuch fullneſs of happineſs ſhall he have, that <hi>nec plus quaerel quam habebit, nec minus habere dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52862:23"/> quam habet:</hi> he that hath the leaſt meaſure of glory ſhall ſeek for no more, nor grieve that he hath ſo little.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. God hath called them unto glory. <hi>Whom he hath Predeſtinated them hath he called: whom he hath called, them hath he Juſtified: and whom he hath Juſtified, them alſo hath he Glorified,</hi> Rom. 8.30. He ſpeaks of it as of the time paſt, as if it were already done: partly, becauſe part of it is preſent, as Peace, Joy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and partly, becauſe it is as ſure as though it were in preſent poſſeſſion, we are called unto glory and vertue; we are called to the obtaining the glory of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt by the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.14. And <hi>S. Paul</hi> exhorteth the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> to walk worthy of God, who had called them to his Kingdom and Glory, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.12. God hath called the Saints out of this World; they are no ſooner admitted into the School of Chriſt, but they learn that the Earth is their baniſhment, and Heaven their Countrey: the end why God calls his people out of the World, is that they might not ſeek for happineſs upon Earth, and that they may make no account of what the wicked do poſſeſs, and thereby ſee that riches and honours are not the portion of the righteous, becauſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52862:24"/> God beſtoweth them chiefly upon his enemies: he leaveth the faireſt part of the World to thoſe that perſecute him, to teach his Children that Heaven is their patrimony and Inheritance.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God hath prepared Heaven for them: Chriſt at the laſt day will ſay to the Sheep whom he will place at his right hand, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, receive the Kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the World,</hi> Mat. 25.34. When Chriſt was leaving the World, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth the hearts of his diſconſolate Diſciples thus, <hi>In my Fathers houſe are many Manſions, if it were not ſo, I would have told you, I go to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a place for you,</hi> John 14.2. The glory muſt be incomparable which God hath treaſured up, and been preparing from eternity. Neither doth God only prepare Heaven for his Saints, but he alſo prepareth them for Heaven: he makes them <hi>meet partakers of the inheritance among the Saints in light,</hi> Col. 1.12. For as wicked men are <hi>veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of wrath ſitted for Deſtruction,</hi> ſo the Saints are <hi>veſſels of glory prepared unto glory,</hi> Rom. 9.22, 23. The Saints do not preſently paſs from a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt to a glorious eſtate, but there is a fitting and an holy preparation cometh between: if a man will wear a Garment, he fits it before he weareth it; ſo God will have his people caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a new mould, that he may fit them for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, before he puts them into the poſſeſſion of it.</p>

                  <p>DIvers reaſons alſo may be given why the Lord will glorifie his people, in reſpect of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Glory is the great deſign of the Saints, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhall be unto them. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſets it down as a diſtinguiſhing Character of the Saints from other men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7. And ſaith, <hi>To them who by patient continuance in well-doing ſeek for glory, and honour, and immortality, eternal life,</hi> i. e. To them ſhall be eternal Life: This is the main thing that the Saints aim at: ſome of them do differ in ſome Opinions, but in this they all agree, <hi>viz.</hi> in aiming at everlaſting glory, the glory of the God of glory: therefore the Lord will not ſuffer them to miſs of the main end and aim of their Souls. The Spouſe cries, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi> Their affections are ſet on things above, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52862:26"/> is in Heaven, their treaſure is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Heaven hath their hearts; they ſeldom look up to Heaven, but they ſigh after it, and are afflicted at their baniſhment: grief makes the Heaven-born Soul cry, Wo is me, becauſe my habitation is prolonged.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Glory is the expectation of the Saints, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20, 21. and they are ſaid, <hi>to rejoyce in hope of the glory of God, Rom.</hi> 5.2. Saving hope is a ſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and undoubted expectation of eternal glory and happineſs, promiſed to us in the word, and purchaſed by Chriſt for us; or elſe a patient waiting for the manifeſtation of the glory of the Sons of God, when Chriſt ſhall appear; this is the hope that is meant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23, 24. there waiting, hope, and expectation are the ſame, <hi>waiting for the adoption, (i. e.)</hi> for the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of glory, to which by our adoption we are intereſted: that look, as the creature is ſaid <hi>verſe</hi> 19. earneſty to expect, they do as it were put forth their heads, to look for the glorious appearing of the Sons of God; ſo all the Saints do earneſtly expect their future promiſed glory, ſaith <hi>Pariſien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Guilielm. Pariſienſ.</note> their hopes are altogether taken up with Heaven, they long for this eternal habitation; the moments that ſtop them here below, ſeem ages; the diverſions, illuſions; the pleaſures of the world ſeem torments to them; the happineſs of the world a dangerous tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now the Spirit of God inſpires them with
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52862:26"/> ſtrong deſires of Heaven, points out the glory of the Bleſſed, fills them with hope of the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their exile; they live always in their deſire after Heaven, comfort themſelves with the expectation, and by a certain hope taſte the happineſs they ſhall one day be ſatisfied with in an everlaſting enjoyment. Now the hope of a Chriſtian is ſure, and being founded on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, who cannot lye, never deludes the Believer that liſtens to them. Jeſus Chriſt hath given to his People ſuch favors, as whereby he ſtrengthens their hope, for what happineſs they yet enjoy not; the death he ſuffered for us, is an aſſurance of that life he prepares for us: neither can we doubt, ſaith <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aug.</note> that we ſhall not reign with him in glory, ſeeing he was willing to die for us upon the Croſs; for what good things may we not expect, when his death is a pledg of his love, and an aſſurance of the happineſs we look for: he that hath this hope, may boaſt himſelf happy before hand; for <hi>Philo</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Philo Jud.</note> the Jew calls it, the fore-runner of joy, a harbinger pleaſure preceeding the eternal one, an ante paſt of bleſſedneſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God hath already given them the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of glory; they are ſealed with the holy Spirit of promiſe, which is <hi>the earnest of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, until the redemption of the purchaſed poſſeſſion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. Here indeed the Saints
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52862:27"/> are Sons, but they are not Heirs inveſted into that bleſſed eſtate they have title to; God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves not all their happineſs for the world to come, but gives them ſomewhat here to bear up their ſpirits, to mitigate and ſweeten their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in their abſence from their Huſband; and to render them happy in the midſt of their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, he ſheds the graces of his Spirit into their ſpirits with ſo much complacency, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with men, they may reliſh the bliſs and happineſs of Angels. He gives them the Holy Ghoſt as a pledg of that glory which one day they ſhall receive with him: you know an earneſt is for ſecurity of a contract; ſo the Holy Ghoſt doth ſecure us of that bleſſed eſtate we ſhall have hereafter in Heaven. An earneſt likewiſe is part of the bargain, a part of the whole that is ſecured; though it be never ſo little, yet it is a part: ſo it is in the operations of the Spirit upon us, in that peace and joy that it worketh in the heart, it is a part of that peace and joy the Saints ſhall for ever enjoy in Heaven. Moreover, an earneſt is given rather for the ſecurity of the party that receives it, then in regard of him that gives it: ſo God by giving us this earneſt of his Spirit, gives us aſſurance of ſalvation, he makes us thereby to read our Names written in the Book of Life; he takes us into that Privy Chamber where the definitive ſentence of our eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is pronounced; he applieth to us the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Jeſus Chriſt, and himſelf interpoſeth the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52862:27"/> caution of his Promiſes; he blots out thoſe mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal diſcontents that labour to throw us into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, advancing our hope by a prelibation of glory; and handles us with ſo much tenderneſs, that he that hath this aſſurance, cannot be made to believe that he can be miſerable in the other world, that hath been ſo happy in this.</p>
                  <p>The Saints alſo have glory here <hi>in primitiis,</hi> they are ſaid to have received <hi>the first fruits of the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.23. to aſſure them that they ſhall have a rich harveſt, and a good crop. Look as ſometimes it falls out with wicked men in their merry ſports, God ſends ſome horror of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience into them, that like an unwholeſome damp, choaketh all their pleaſure, which is the firſt fruits of Hell, a taſte of the cup of wrath which the damned drink of in Hell: ſo when a godly man is in his ſad dumps, when he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt buried in the gulf of troubles, then God's Spirit doth, as <hi>Jonathan,</hi> take a little honey up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the top of his rod, and gives it him to eat, which comforteth his fainting ſpirit; the Spirit of God then droppeth a little comfort upon an afflicted heart, gives him a taſte of the rivers of pleaſures, and ſecretly aſſureth him of the favor of God in Chriſt, and that one day he ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy communion with him to all eternity; theſe are the very firſt fruits of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>The godly are already glorified in part, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that wherein eternal life and glory do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, they have now in part; they know God in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52862:28"/> part; they do here enjoy God and Chriſt in part; they have now communion with God in Chriſt; and Chriſt is ſaid to live in them, and God is ſaid to make his abode in them: that Soul muſt needs be glorious, wherein God and Chriſt do make their abode. It is true what a holy Man ſaid, a Believer hath <hi>Coelum in ſe, &amp; Chriſtum in illo Coelo:</hi> A Chriſtian hath Heaven within him, and Chriſt in that Heaven. Where God and Chriſt is, certainly there is Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe Chriſt their Head is glorified, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt the Members alſo be glorified; they are united to Chriſt; he is their Huſband, they are his Spouſe: now where he is, they muſt alſo be, as he himſelf tells his Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 14. Now is the time of contract only; the time of the Marriage ſolemnity ſhall be at the appearing of Chriſt. <hi>Now we are the Sons of God, but it doth not appear what we ſhall be,</hi> 1 John 3.2. <hi>But when he who is our life ſhall appear, we ſhall alſo appear with him in glory,</hi> Coloſ. 3.4. Chriſt in his own Perſon is now glorious: <hi>Ought not Christ to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer theſe things, and enter into his glory,</hi> Luke 24.26. This glory is given him by God his Father, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. <hi>John</hi> 17.24. Now when it is ſaid, God the Father gave him glory, it cannot be meant of eſſential glory, becauſe he had that from all eternity; but by glory is meant, the glory of his Mediatorſhip, and the glory he had after his Reſurrection, wherein we ſhall be made like unto him, ſitting at the right hand of God.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52862:28"/> Now real glory is given to Chriſt in regard of his Humane Nature, ſo it was manifeſt in time; but in reſpect of his Deity, he had it with his Father <hi>before the world was,</hi> John 17.5. As the Sun, when there is a Cloud between us and it, the Sun ſtill keeps its ſplendor, but when the Cloud is gone, we ſee it: So Chriſt in regard of his Deity had this glory always; it was hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from him in regard of the infirmities which he took upon him, as ſufferings, death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now Chriſt our Head being glorified, all his Members that ſuffer with him ſhall alſo be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified together; they are now glorified <hi>in capite,</hi> and when Chriſt hath prepared places for all his Members, then he will take them home to his Father's houſe: Chriſt is now preparing their glory, and fitting their heavenly Manſions; he is decking their Crowns of Righteouſneſs, he is trimming their Robes. Chriſt is now in his own Perſon glorious, but Chriſt myſtical is not glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, it is in a ſuffering condition; there are many of his Members that are not yet brought home to God: Chriſt hath a care of his myſtical Body, as of his natural Body; he gave his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Body to redeem his myſtical Body; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as he is glorious in his natural Body, ſo he will be glorious in his myſtical Body; for St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>he ſhall come to be glorified in his Saints.</hi> The Son of God roſe gloriouſly out of his Tomb; and after he had given aſſurance of it to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, he was taken up into Heaven, to reign
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52862:29"/> there eternally with his Father; the Angels made a part of his Triumph; his Body that was pierced with the nails, rent with ſtripes, torn with thorns, was ſet at the right hand of his Father on a Throne; whoſe Ornament was Juſtice, and the Foundation Mercy, as one well noteth. His myſtical Body ſhall receive the like glorious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment; the Saints ſhall be admitted into the Society of the Bleſſed, and reign in Heaven with the Angels: Thoſe Members that have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the quarrel of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall be freed from all miſeries, and reign in glory everlaſtingly with their Head, that the bleſſedneſs of Jeſus Chriſt may have its accompliſhment, and he may be as happy in his Members, as in his Perſon. Jeſus Chriſt and his Members are united in their ſufferings on earth, and by a neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence we may be aſſured, they ſhall be ſo one day in their glory in Heaven: To this end Chriſt prayed for his Church to his Father, when him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was upon earth; <hi>The glory which thou gavest me, I have given them: Father, I will that they alſo whom thou hast given me be where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me, John</hi> 17.22, 24. It is obſervable, that in other things when Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks to his Father, it is with ſo much reſpect, that he ſeemeth rather a Servant then a Son; but when he asks that his Members may reign with him in glory, it is with ſo much liberty of ſpeech; that his Requeſt is rather a determination then a Prayer: <hi>Volo Pater,</hi>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:52862:29"/> Father, I will that where I am, there my Servants may be.</p>

               <p>NOw that I may ſet forth the nature of the Saints glory, you are to know, that there is no ſpeciſical, or eſſential, difference between our gracious and glorious eſtate, as there is no ſpecifical or eſſential difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Corn of the Firſt-fruits, and that of the whole Harveſt, only ſome accidental differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: as there is no ſpecifical difference between a Child, and a grown Man; they have both the ſame eſſential parts and principles, there is only an alteration of degrees, not of parts, <hi>&amp; gradus non variat ſpeciem:</hi> Now our preſent eſtate is our Infancy, our future eſtate is our Man-hood; for the preſent the Children of God have glory given them; godly Men are for the preſent glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious: the Scripture calls them nothing elſe but bleſſed; yea, even then they are bleſſed, when the world looks upon them as moſt miſerable; when ſhame, reproach and trouble is caſt upon them, then doth the Spirit of glory reſt upon them; they having grace beſtowed upon them, have glory. Glory is nothing elſe but the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, the brightneſs of grace; <hi>Vita gratiae nihil
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52862:30"/> eſt aliud quam aetas infantilis gloriae:</hi> he that is gracious, is glorious. We ſhall have the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Bodies and Souls after the Reſurrection as we have in this life, only ſome alteration in reſpect of ſome new qualities; as in our firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the death of Sin to the life of Righteouſneſs, there is no tranſmutation of the eſſence, but an alteration of the qualities, or a ſuper-introduction of new qualities, by which we are ſaid to be new Creatures, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. not in quantity but in quality; ſo in Heaven we ſhall become new Creatures in reſpect of what we are now, and thoſe very qualities which do principally concur to the conſtitution of our happineſs in Heaven, are in ſome meaſure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to us in our firſt regeneration; now we have drops, then rivers of delights, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.8. both the ſame in nature.</p>
               <p>This will be the more evident, if we examine wherein our happineſs hereafter doth conſiſt, and compa ing it with our preſent eſtate. Our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and ſupernatural bleſſedneſs conſiſteth in the fruition of ſuch an object as is perfectly, all-ſufficiently, and principally good, which is only God; therefore it ſtandeth in our perfect union to, and communion with God; the faculties of the ſoul being by the Almighty power of God dilated, extended and enlarged ſo far, as to be as it were capable of the fulneſs of God, and by the perfect operations of the underſtanding, will and affections, united to God in all their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52862:30"/> and when theſe natural, weak and vile Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of ours, by the ſame hand of Omnipotency are transfigured and transformed into ſpiritual, powerful and glorious Bodies, and ſo united to the Soul, then are we come to the perfection of our bleſſedneſs; the properties of which bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs are, Firſt, That it is everlaſting. Secondly, That we ſhall diſcern it ſo to be. And thirdly, That as it fulfilleth the largeſt deſires of our hearts, ſo we ſhall be extraordinarily affected with it, and perpetually affected to it, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly deſirous of it; our glory conſiſteth not in having what our weak Souls can now wiſh for, but what they can deſire when they are glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly corroborated and enlarged.</p>
               <p>So that now you ſee there is no ſpecifical or eſſential difference, but only a gradual or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial difference between the ſtate of grace here, and the ſtate of glory hereafter; for <hi>Regnum coeleſte eſt Dei contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platio, glorificatio,</hi>

What is an handful to the whole Crop? what is a drop of Water to the whole Ocean? what is the light of the Moon and Stars, and Candle-light, to that of the Sun? and yet there is no eſſential difference between theſe, no more then between a mountain and a mole-hill, both having the ſame common nature. God can raiſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as well as ſubſtances to a moſt eminent and glorious perfection; if we in the ſtate of reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, find ſuch comforts as are many times un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and glorious, even in this our day of ſmall things, that they make us to glory in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, and to triumph over the greateſt evils in this life, how abſolute and tranſcendently ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing ſhall our contentment be, when we ſhall be above the reach of all evils, and be filled with all perfection?</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:52862:31"/>
               <p>Hence we may learn how to conceive of the bleſſedneſs of our future eſtate, <hi>viz.</hi> not to think of it after a carnal manner, as if it did conſiſt in eating and drinking, ſleeping, marrying, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing of Silver and Gold, and Houſes richly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and adorned, or in a Turkiſh Paradiſe, in ſenſual delights, and following our ſports and recreations; but rather in exerciſes of Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, in a glorious and heavenly communion with the holy Trinity, Saints and Angels, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. in living a Celeſtial and Angelical kind of life, as <hi>Luke</hi> 20.35. ſuch as is deſcribed <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.2, 3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.20. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.20. <hi>Luke</hi> 15.7. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.13, 14. A ſincere Chriſtian condition, and heavenly converſation, is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure delineation and repreſentation of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py condition of the glorified; and the Saints do even live as it were an Heaven upon Earth; they begin to live eternally and bleſſedly, as ſoon as they begin to be in Chriſt: and if Glory deſerveth ſuch great admiration and eſtimation, Grace, which is a ſpark and principle of it, can be no mean thing; therefore let thoſe that are ſanctified in Chriſt, ſo far magnifie themſelves againſt the inſolencies of ungodly men.</p>

This St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake, who in that divine rapture into the Third Heaven ſaw a flaſh of the Tranſcendent glory of the Saints. The glorious beauty of Heaven and Earth is the object of the eye, yet no eye ever ſaw ſuch glory: our ears hear more then our eyes can ſee; we hear of glorious things done in all parts of the World, and yet no ear ever heard of ſuch glory: our hearts can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive more then our eyes can ſee, or ears can hear, or we can fancy greater things then can be preſented to the eye; yet we cannot conceive the glory of the Sons of God. Our glory doth not appear; we have treaſures of happineſs, but they are hidden in the field: our Tranſcendent happineſs is like a curious piece of Arras roled up, not put down, and expoſed to the view of men; we are glorious Stars, but yet we do not appear above the <hi>Horizon,</hi> the Earth doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe it ſelf between us and the ſet Sun,

And ſo it is not obvious to carnal eyes, which if it were, it would turn the moſt ſenſual <hi>Epicures</hi> into mortified Saints: but the wicked want a ſpiritual eye to diſcern ſpiritual glory; Gods people are worth Millions of men, but they are Gods <hi>hidden ones,</hi> Pſal. 83.3. The world know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them not, becauſe they know not God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.1. And as <hi>Moſes</hi> his face when it ſhone, had a vail over it; ſo the glory of grace hath a vail over it, that not a glimpſe of it appeareth to the wicked, much leſs doth the life of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs glory appear to them. Theſe things do hide the glorious condition of the godly from the wicked:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Their outward troubles, their outward mean and baſe condition obſcureth their glory, ſo that wicked men think godlineſs to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible thing: What hid the Majeſty of Chriſt from the eye of the <hi>Jews?</hi> why was he a man rejected and deſpiſed among men? it was the baſeneſs of his outward condition that hid the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52862:33"/> glory of the only begotten Son of God: he came in the form of a Servant among the <hi>Jews,</hi> who expected his coming in Princely pomp; it was alſo the many troubles he endured for our ſins, becauſe he was Crowned with a Crown of Thornes, and had not a Crown of Glory upon his Head, therefore his glory did not appear: the carnal and blind <hi>Jews</hi> thought the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Meſſiah</hi> when he came, would not be thus miſerable, and ſo generally hated as Chriſt was: thus when the wicked ſee godly men almoſt overwhelmed with troubles, and even buried in the Gulf of outward calamities, and look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as of all men the moſt miſerable and deſpicable, they preſently think there is no glory in an holy life. The miſeries of the Saints are publique, their advantages walk in the dark; men ſee what they ſuffer, but doubt of what they hope for; and in the judgment of Infidels their Religion paſſeth for an impoſture, becauſe the good things it promiſeth are inviſible, but the evils it threatens are ſenſible and preſent. <hi>We are ſaith</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>like thoſe great Trees, which during the ſharpneſs of the Winter, are naked of all their leaves; their life is encloſed in their roots, their vigour is retired into their Sap, and all their Soul and vegetation they have, is hid from the eyes of the beholders; but their death is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, every branch publiſheth; it and all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs the</hi> Winter <hi>hath brought upon them, are ſo
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52862:34"/> many arguments to make us doubt of their life. Thus it is with God's Children; they are dead, and they are alive, but their Life is in a Cloud, their Death manifeſt; the perſecutions they ſuffer, the temptations they encounter, the conflicts they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo, perſwade wicked and unbelieving perſons, that their Life is but a languiſhing and doleful Death; but their vigour is over-ſhadowed, their glory is hid with Chriſt in God: and as the Spring muſt needs return to convince the ignorant, that a Tree that hath loſt its leaves in the</hi> Winter, <hi>is not dead, ſo muſt the general Reſurrection happen to aſſure the unbelieving World, that the Life of a Chriſtian perſecuted by the World is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe there is no outward excellency in grace, therefore their glory cannot appear to wicked men; nothing pleaſeth a carnal eye but external excellency, and grace hath little of that. St. <hi>James</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.</note> tells us, <hi>That gay clothes and a gold Ring is in more eſteem then Faith;</hi> but Chriſt goes contrary to the World. <q>
                        <hi>Cyrus,</hi> in his ſpeech to his Soldiers, told them that were Footmen, if they would follow him, he would make them Horſemen: he told them that were Horſemen, if they would follow him, he would ſet them over Chariots: if they were Rulers of Villages, he would give them Cities: if of Cities, he would make them Rulers of Provinces.</q> Chriſt Preached otherwiſe, <hi>He that will be my Diſciple,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52862:34"/> let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs:</hi> let him deny his honours, and become baſe for my ſake: let him deny his riches, and become poor for my ſake: let him deny his life, and become miſerable: what happineſs, what glory is there, will a wicked man ſay? I can ſee no excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Piety, if this be the portion of God's Children. Grace indeed is like the <hi>Ark,</hi> which within was over-laid with pure Gold, and a pot of <hi>Manna</hi> was in it, but the out-ſide was cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Badgers-skins, and Sheep-skins: ſo grace is inwardly overlaid with pure Gold, cloathed with glory, and within it there is a pot of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> even joy unſpeakable; Yet becauſe the outſide of grace is covered with Badgers skins, and wicked men do judge according to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, therefore the inward excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and glory thereof doth not appear to them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe wicked men think that holy men, becauſe they are miſerable in this life, belong not to God, and that their miſeries here are but the fore-runners of eternal ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. It is a good ſaying of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi>

Lord, I have ſuffered but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for thee, I have done nothing for thee, that thou ſhouldeſt thus glorifie me.</p>

Therefore their glory doth not yet appear, becauſe the Sons of God, while they are in theſe earthly houſes, are not fit for ſuch glory; mortality is no fit ſubject to have immortal glory to be put upon it; theſe mortal Bodies of ours, are not fit to be inveſted with the Robes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible honour: yea, theſe Bodies of ours, wherein ſin liveth, are not fit to enjoy commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, who is of purer eyes then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold any unclean thing; no, there muſt be a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of theſe earthly tabernacles; mortality muſt be ſwallowed up of life; <hi>this corruptible, muſt put on incorruption; this mortal, muſt put on immortality;</hi> then, and not before, ſhall the ſurpaſſing glory of the Saints appear: as Chriſt ſaith, we muſt not put new wine into old bottles, nor patch an old garment with a piece of new cloth; thus Chriſt will not put the ſoul-raviſhing

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> 1. The glory of God himſelf; God will manifeſt and diſplay his glory before them; we ſhall ſee God as fully and clearly as we are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by God's immediate communication of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52862:39"/> to us without any external means, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24. God will be all, and in all; that is, God the Father, Son, Holy Ghoſt, will then reign immediately over his Church by himſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any outward means; and will fill his Church with his own light, life, love and glory. It is a diſputed caſe, whether we ſhall ſee God with our bodily eyes? it is anſwered, that the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God being purely ſpiritual, cannot be ſeen with bodily eyes; and God is ſtyled by the Apoſtle, abſolutely <hi>inviſible.</hi> Again, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels behold the glory of God, and the Souls of the Saints now in Heaven ſee him, but have not eyes; therefore the ſight of God is rather an act of the mind, then of the Body; intellectual knowledg, not corporeal light: But though we ſhall not with our eyes ſee the Divine Eſſence, yet the Divine Eſſence will abundantly manifeſt it ſelf in the Humane Nature of Chriſt now glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified to our eyes; they ſhall ſee him, God in him, his Attributes in him: in this life the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are a Glaſs to give us the ſight of God; in Heaven the Humane Nature of Chriſt is a Glaſs to give our bodily eyes the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The glory of Chriſt ſhall be revealed; his glory as Head of the Church, as Saviour of the Body to which he is united; his glory as Judge of the World ſhall be revealed; it is ſaid of him, that <hi>he ſhall appear in glory,</hi> Coloſ. 3.4. and that <hi>he ſhall come in his own glory, and in the glory of his Father, and in the glory of his holy Angels,</hi>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:52862:39"/> Luke 9.26. and his appearing to judge the World, is called <hi>a glorious appearing,</hi> Tit. 2.13. His firſt appearing was mean, the ſecond ſhall be glorious.</p>

               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. II.</head>
                  <p>THe Reaſons that the appearing of Chriſt ſhall be glorious, are theſe:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe God hath appointed Chriſt to judge the World; therefore Chriſt will in the latter day appear gloriouſly: whom God appointed to be the Saviour of the World, him hath God appointed to judge the World, <hi>John</hi> 5.22. Chriſt is God's Delegate to judge the World; God will have his Judge to appear in glory. Earthly Kings will have their itinerary Judges to appear in pomp, and to judge Malefactors; they appear both in terror and honour; how do all the Gentry give their attendance? how are they attended with Spear-men, and the Trumpets ſounding before them, and are inveſted with Robes of honour? Thus God will have his Judge of all the World to appear in glory upon his Tribunal, and therefore chargeth all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of Heaven to attend his glorious Majeſty; chargeth the Arch-angels to ſound the Trump to awaken the ſleepy Priſoners in the Grave, the dark Priſon of Death: think ye what a glorious appearance it will be. If <hi>Peter</hi> was amazed at
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52862:40"/> Chriſt upon Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> when he ſaw but a glimpſe of his glory at the Transfiguration; what appearance will that be, when Chriſt ſhall come in the brightneſs of his glory, and all the Angels and Saints with him cloathed in brightneſs of glory?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe Chriſt will be glorious before thoſe that did diſhonour him: Chriſt did appear to men in the form of a Servant, then he was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, a rejected Chriſt; then was he crowned with a Crown of Thorns, and had no better Sceptre then a Reed; then was he a reviled, a buffeted Chriſt; the malicious Jews did moſt contumeliouſly ſpit on his face, and every Sinner would contradict, oppoſe and perſecute him; then was he a crucified Chriſt, a Man of ſorrows and of ſhame; every one looked upon him as a deſpiſed Man, none would own him for the Son of God: yea, the Jews did accuſe him for Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, for telling them that he was the Son of God; therefore Chriſt will appear in glory one day, to the horror and terror of theſe men that did thus blaſphemouſly abuſe him that was King of Kings, that did reject him that came to ſave them, that ſo Chriſt might be glorified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and upon them, in taking venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on their Souls and Bodies; then thoſe that did mock at him, put a Crown of Thorns on his head, a Reed in his hand, ſhall ſee he was Heir of a better Crown then the Crowns of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Kings and Emperors; then they that did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumeliouſly
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52862:40"/> ſpit upon, and buffet him in ſcorn, ſhall ſee they did this to one whom the Angels reverence: he will make Kings to throw down their Crowns and Scepters to his feet; then thoſe that ſcorned and deſpiſed him, ſhall ſee that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily he is the Son of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe glory is terrible: the more glorious Chriſt appears at the laſt day, the more terror will be upon the wicked; therefore the glorious appearing of Chriſt to judge the World, is called the terror of the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. If the ſight of one Angel in glory be terrible, what will the ſight of Chriſt be, who will appear ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more glorious then all the Angels be? if godly men, that had good conſciences, were ſo horribly affrighted at the appearance of an Angel in leſſer glory, how will wicked men, that have accuſing conſciences, be afraid at the beholding Chriſt's glorious appearance? if holy men were ſo amazed at good tidings, becauſe brought to them by a glorious Meſſenger, how will wicked men be amazed to hear the ſentence of condemnation pronounced againſt them by the Lord of glory? To ſee God in Chriſt, is the unſpeakable happineſs of the Saints in Heaven; and to behold Chriſt as a Judge ſitting upon the Tribunal, will be one of the greateſt torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puniſhments of damned men and Devils. The Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.7, 8. <hi>He ſhall be revealed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52862:41"/> from Heaven, with his holy Angels;</hi> there is the glorious Majeſty of Chriſt: and <hi>in flaming fire, taking vengeance,</hi> &amp;c. there is the amazing ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of his glorious appearing. Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.29, 30. <hi>Immediately after the tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe days, ſhall the Sun be darkened, and the Moon ſhall not give her light; and the Stars ſhall fall from Heaven, and the powers of Heaven ſhall be ſhaken; and then ſhall appear the Sign of the Son of Man in Heaven; and then ſhall all the Kinreds of the Earth mourn: and they ſhall ſee the Son of Man coming in the Clouds of Heaven with power and great glory: And he ſhall ſend his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels with a great ſound of a Trumpet, and they ſhall gather together his Elect from the four Winds, and from one end of the Heavens to the other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Conſider here the Signs foregoing his coming, <hi>verſe</hi> 29. <hi>the Sun, Moon, and Stars ſhall loſe their light</hi> in a ſtrange and wonderful manner, as it were hiding their faces at the coming of the Sun of Righteouſneſs. <hi>The Stars ſhall fall from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Powers of Heaven ſhall be ſhaken.]</hi> The higher and more glorious parts of the Creation ſhall ſuffer a wonderful alteration at his coming. <hi>Then ſhall appear the Sign of the Son of Man.</hi>] Which <hi>Muſculus</hi> and <hi>Arelius</hi> take to be the Sign of the Croſs, which ſhould be gloriouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in the eyes of the World, both for ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to all the Enemies of his Croſs, and for the joy of all that believe in Chriſt crucified. But others take it for Chriſt himſelf, ſhewing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52862:41"/> in the ſame Humane Nature wherein he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, now gloriouſly appearing for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of his Enemies, and full redemption of his Servants. Then ſhall all the wicked of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions mourn, their guilty conſciences being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized with unſpeakable horror at the ſight of their Judge, whom they ſhall ſee coming, as in a Chariot of Clouds, armed with power, and ſhining in glory, ſending forth his Angels by ſound of Trumpet, to ſummons all the Elect that ſleep in the duſt in any part of the World, to come and give their attendance upon Chriſt their glorious Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.27. you have the coming of Chriſt expreſſed, and his acts to be performed at his coming. His coming is magnified by the glorious Majeſty of his Father, wherein he ſhall appear, and thoſe bleſſed Attendants which ſhould follow him: <hi>For the Son of Man ſhall come in the glory of his Father, with his Angels,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>But it may be doubted, why Chriſt ſhould be ſaid to come in the glory of his Father, ſith it ſhall be his own glory wherein he ſhall appear?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> It may be ſaid to be the glory of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in three reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To ſhew his unity in Eſſence with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; in that he cometh in the glory of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he ſhall come in his own glory; according to that of our Saviour, <hi>I and the Father are one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. By comparing the Humiliation of his Per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon here in the fleſh, with the glory of the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52862:42"/> Divine Nature ſhining perfectly in the Father, even at that time when it was Ecclipſed and veil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him by the human Nature: ſo that in this ſpeech he compareth the meaneſs of a Servant wherein he now appeared, with the glory of his Father wherein then he ſhould appear.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It was the glory of the Father, becauſe the Father hath committed all Judgment to him; and after this his glorious coming he is to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up the Kingdom to God the Father; and therefore in the mean time he is ſaid to come in the glory of the Father.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To which perhaps may be added a fourth: That the glory of the Father ſhineth in the Son, who is the Image of God, and the brightneſs of his Father's glory. All the glory of the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> meeting together, are nothing comparable to this glory of the Father, wherein Chriſt ſhall ſhew himſelf at his coming. The glory of all Earthly Kingdoms viewed at one Landskip (as the Devil ſhewed them our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our) were nothing to that fullneſs of glory where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Bleſſed Saviour ſhall reveale himſelf. The glory of his abaſement was wonderful, when the Star lighted the way to his lodging, an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel brought word from Heaven of his Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then of his Nativity; when the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil left him, and the Victory to him, and Angels came to Miniſter unto him, when Devils roared, and left their Poſſeſſions at his call; when Winds and Waves were ſilent at a Word of his mouth;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52862:42"/> when Loaves and dead Fiſhes, multiplyed upon his bleſſings upon the Table, or between the Teeth of the Eaters; when all ſorts of diſeaſes gave place, and Death it ſelf yeilded up her dead at his command. And yet beloved, that difference ſhall be between the glory of Chriſt at his coming, and this of his abaſement, which is between the glory of the Father, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed meanneſs of a Servant. Moreover the glory of Chriſt ſhall be magnified by the bleſſed attendants that ſhall follow him; and they are his Angels: at that day they ſhall be employed as his ſpecial Inſtruments in gathering the Wheat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Barn, and binding up the Tares to be burnt with fire unquenchable: O faithful Soul! how joyfully ſhouldeſt thou expect this bleſſed meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing! O how happy will that day be, when the holy Angels of Chriſt ſhall come to meet thee riſing from the Dead, and with abundance of joy ſhall embrace and welcome thee to thine everlaſting home! While thou art ſolitary, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, and deſpiſed in the World, comfort thy ſelf in expectation of this bleſſed ſociety, with whom thou ſhalt remain for ever, with whom thou ſhalt joyn in ſweeteſt <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> and words of Praiſe, to him that ſitteth upon the Throne for evermore. Ear hath not heard the ſweetneſs of thoſe Songs, wherein the Saints ſhall joyn with thoſe bleſſed Angels.</p>

                  <p>THe glory of the Saints themſelves ſhall be revealed, they ſhall appear with Chriſt in glory.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Their appearance in glory with Chriſt in Judgment, will make the coming of Chriſt more glorious and terrible. When Earthly Kings will ſhew the glory of their Kingdom, they will always have a pompous train to follow them: thus Chriſt the greateſt of Kings, delighting to manifeſt his glory, will come attended with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Troops of Angels and Saints.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe it will make much for the glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Saints, and that two ways.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe they ſhall come as Judges, and ſhall ſit upon Thrones Judging the Wicked; how will wicked men quake, when they ſhall appear before thoſe godly men, whom they hated and derided: now the Saints ſhall Judge the World, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Aſſiſtendo,</hi> they ſhall be as Aſſiſtants of Chriſt, they ſhall aſſiſt as ſo many Juſtices with Chriſt, who is the Lord-chief-Juſtice of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Approbando:</hi> They ſhall approve and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud his judgment: they ſhall ſit on Thrones of Everlaſting glory, and ſhall (as Gods Aſſeſſours) give their voices and conſents unto his juſt Judgment againſt the Wicked.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:52862:43"/>3. <hi>Teſtificative:</hi> They ſhall bring in evidence againſt the Wicked, ſo that all their mouthes ſhall be ſtopped. The godly ſhall then be heard to ſpeak, and ſhall ſay to Chriſt, Lord, this is the man that hated me, ſcoft at me, perſecuted and oppreſſed me.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It will make much for the Saints glory, that they ſhall appear glorious in the open ſight of the whole world. The Saints ſhall ſee the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Wicked, and the Wicked ſhall ſee the glorious Salvation of the Saints, and their happineſs; their appearing with Chriſt in glory will make much for their glory, <hi>Quia unum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quod<expan>

Moreover, the godly themſelves ſhall mutually admire one anothers Glory, and admire Chriſt in one another: <hi>Peter</hi> ſhall admire Chriſt in the glory conferred on <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ſhall admire Chriſt in the glory conferred on <hi>Peter,</hi> they ſhall mutually rejoyce in each others glory; as here on Earth they do mourn and grieve for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>Chriſt will have his Saints to behold the Damnation of the Wicked, that ſo they might admire the free grace of God, and glorifie his Name, that he ſhould deliver them from ſo great Damnation: <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.28. And God will have the Wicked to behold the glory of the Saints, that ſo the Wicked may in vain miſerably torment themſelves with envy at the ſurpaſſing glory and happineſs of the Saints, and that they may alſo curſe and torment themſelves with inward grief, that they ſhould be ſuch fools as to loſe ſuch glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as the Saints do enjoy; then will they cry out, Oh we might have had thoſe Crowns as well as they, but now we muſt have the vials of Wrath powred upon our heads, inſtead of having Crowns of glory ſet upon them: we muſt now keep company with Devils and Infernal Fiends in Hell, when we might have enjoyed commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God and his Angels in Heaven.</p>

               <p n="1">1. IS there unſpeakable glory to be revealed in the Saints hereafter; then be not troubled at your preſent ſtate, whatever it is; O ye righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, let not your preſent mean, obſcure, baſe condition in the World trouble your hearts, but lift up your heads becauſe of the glory which ſhall be revealed; be not troubled at the ſhame of the Croſs, be not terrified with the rage and cruelty of ungodly men at any time, fear none of theſe things, becauſe it is your Fathers will to give you a Kingdom of glory. Bid afflictions wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come for glories-ſake, bid reproaches wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come for glories-ſake; let this comfort thy Soul in all abaſements and preſſures, yet I ſhall be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified: the World is pleaſed to reveal their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice in me, but my God will reveal glory in me: the World reveals their hatred againſt me, but my God will reveal his love in me; how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable ſoever I am at this preſent, yet I ſhall appear in glory.</p>
               <p>You know the glory of Chriſt was hidden for thirty three years; though he was the Lord of glory, yet how deſpicable and contemptible was he? all men ſcorn'd him, rejected him, mocked him, perſecuted him; but now he is in glory, and will one day appear in glory to the World: put caſe thou ſhalt paſs as many years in reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and afflictions, yet thou ſhalt appear in glory
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52862:45"/> together with Chriſt, and thou doſt at preſent but drink of the ſame Cup the Lord of glory drank of before thee. Ye that are afflicted for Righteouſneſs ſake, what cauſe have ye to count it all joy, for if any have more abundantly revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of glory in them, undoubtedly they have who have abounded in ſufferings for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This ſhould work in us a bleſſed contempt of all the torments and cruelties that Hell or Earth can invent, or execute; a few hours in Heaven will make amends for all the tortures of this life, were every torture an Hell to us: Oh the perfection, beauty, glory, and tranſcendent excellency of thoſe joys which ſhall be revealed in that day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The conſideration of the revelation of this glory may fortifie our Spirits againſt all fears and dangers; though the thing feared be not preſent, yet fears are many times preſent with us; there is enough in this conſideration to raiſe our hearts above fears; the hope of this revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion heightens a Chriſtians courage, gives him the Almighty for his ſecond, and makes him Triumph over all his fears, and overcome all difficulties: this hath ſo fortified many Saints and Martyrs that they have even laught at Tyrants and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, the greateſt cruelty being not able to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh from them what they loved: the hope of eternal glory will ſtrengthen the heart againſt the worſt of fears and dangers which the worſt of times and men can threaten: were this hope well kept up, it would carry a believer through

This likewiſe may ſtrengthen the hearts of God's Children againſt the preſent ſnares, which Sin, <hi>Satan,</hi> or the World, can lay before them; ſince there ſhall be a Revelation of glory in us, what Soul is there that is prevented and enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the love of God, that may not ſee good ground to diſdain all the offers that a ſinful world can make him to enſnare his Soul; as <hi>Abraham</hi> did not only reject the offers of the King of <hi>Sodom,</hi> but did it with diſdain, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.23. The moſt high God was <hi>Abraham's</hi> portion, therefore he would not be beholden to a wicked King for any thing, no not ſo much as a ſhoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latchet; he would not be ſo injurious to the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſour of Heaven and Earth: ſo when a child of God is tempted to that which is evil, with preſent honours, profits, and preferments in the world, this will make him with a holy diſdain to refuſe theſe proffers that the World, and the God of the World make unto him, becauſe of the glory that ſhall be revealed in him: the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the World are very falſe, and thoſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary contentments it allures us with, gives us nothing but real torments in the end.</p>

                  <p>MOreover, that there ſhall a time come when God ſhall make manifeſt and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious the glory of his Children, is evident from that inſtinct that God hath put into the Creatures to wait for that time; for St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us in the nineteeth verſe of this eighth Chapter to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, That the earneſt expectaction of the Creature waiteth for the manifeſtation of the Sons of God.</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.3.16. tells us, that there are ſome things in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles which are hard to be underſtood; in the number of thoſe My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, this Text of St. <hi>Paul</hi> is one.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. By Creature, we cannot underſtand the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, that they do earneſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect this manifeſtation, as <hi>Origen</hi>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52862:47"/> as is made ſubject to vanity for the ſin of Man, ſo the Angels are not; there is no ſhadow of privative vanity in any of the glorious Angels, they are perfectly holy, perfectly, immutably happy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, he ſpeaks of the Creature which is ſubject to a bondage of corruption; the Angels are not ſubject to any ſuch bondage: every word in theſe verſes makes againſt this Opinion. <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> thinketh, that becauſe the Angels are now miniſtring Spirits to the Sons of God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Angels are ſet over Kingdoms and Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to manage Wars for and againſt King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, hence they are ſubject to ſome vanity: I anſwer, though the Angels do miniſter to the Saints, yet this is not vanity, neither is it againſt their wills thus to miniſter; for ſeeing it is the will of God they ſhould attend on his People, they do it with all readineſs of mind; their greateſt delight is to pleaſe God. Their Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency over Kingdoms and Wars, is to reſtrain and direct them according to God's command, without any vanity or corruption in them; it is part of mans vanity and miſery to be employed in Wars, it is a bondage of corruption to him; but not to Angels, who are both Spectators and Actors without corruption.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It cannot be denied, but that the Angels do earneſtly deſire the glory of the Sons of God, but they do not groan together with us, and are not in pain together with us: therefore it muſt

IT cannot be underſtood of the <hi>new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> in Man, the Image of God renewed by the Spirit of Chriſt in righteouſneſs and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as ſome would have it; for although grace begun tendeth to a glorious perfection, and it deſireth its own perfection, yet,</p>

                  <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>How the Creature is here ſaid to wait and expect, ſome queſtion; becauſe the words</hi> [ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation <hi>and</hi> hope, <hi>&amp;c.] are here attributed to the Creature, there are ſome that think it cannot be meant inanimate creatures void of ſenſe, and of animate creatures who are void of reaſon.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> 1. In anſwer to this, you are to know, it is uſual in Scripture to attribute ſenſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon both to ſenſeleſs and ſenſitive creatures, by a figure called <hi>Proſopopeia,</hi> feigning them to be Perſons: as when God calls to the Heavens and Earth, <hi>Hear, O Heavens, and hearken, O Earth: Be aſtoniſhed, O ye Heavens;</hi> All ſuch phraſes are but figurative ſpeeches: ſo here, when it is ſaid, the Creature groaneth, hopeth, expecteth, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth, they are but figurative ſpeeches; the Holy Ghoſt feigning the whole Creation as a Perſon expecting and groaning for this glory: he makes whole Nature to ſpeak and groan, when affording words unto her ſorrow, he makes her wiſh our change, and her deliverance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Creature may be ſaid earneſtly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect this glorious manifeſtation in two reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect of that natural inſtinct which is in every creature, forcibly inclining them to their firſt created perfection, of which for the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52862:50"/> ſin of man they are deprived, which makes the creature reſtleſs till it doth attain to it: This na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural tendency to a better ſtate, is that which the Apoſtle calls <hi>hope,</hi> and <hi>expectation, groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> &amp;c. A learned man expreſſeth it by this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude; As the Needle in the Mariner's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, hath a natural inclination to the North Pole, from which if it be removed, it ſhakes, trembles, and is in continual motion, never reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, till it cometh and be ſetled toward the North again: So it is with the Creature, Sin hath put the whole Creation out of order, it cannot do that good for which God at firſt made the creatures; therefore they hope, wait, groan, are in pain and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>avel, till they be ſet in order again, and attain to their primitive and more glorious ſtate and condition.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They may be ſaid to wait for this glorious Manifeſtation, becauſe the whole Creation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth in that State and order, wherein now it is by reaſon of Sin, though ſubject to ſuch infinite variations, alterations, corruptio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now the reaſon why they do ſo earneſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, is becauſe they would be fully ſerviceable to their Creatour, they would be in ſuch a ſtate, as may render them perfectly conducible to the glory of their Creatour: it is their unhappineſs and miſery that Sin hath rendred them ſo much unſerviceable to him; it is againſt their will ſaith the Apoſtle; it is againſt their very natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and inclination that they muſt be ſlaves and drudges to ſinful Rebells: Moreover, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by a natural inſtinct do naturally tend to their own higheſt and ultimate perfection: Sin ſpoiled them of it, and keeps them from this perfection, but this natural inclination is ſtill in the Creature; perfection and duration is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of all Creatures: But this perfection ſhall not, and cannot be enjoyed by the Creature, till there be a manifeſtation of the Sons of God: hence 'tis ſaid, they earneſtly expect that mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation: the Saints expect Chriſt's manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in glory, for till he appear, they ſhall not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in glory: The Creatures expect their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, for till the Sons of God appear, they

                  <p>NOW if the Creature who ſhall not have any anſwerable meaſure of glory (but be only brought into glorious liberty, not into glory it ſelf, as <hi>Calvin</hi>

                        <hi>Calvin</hi> in Loc.</note> noteth) doth thus wait for this glorious manifeſtation, how much more ſhould we whom it mainly concerneth, and for whoſe ſakes that day was created and ordained, and who ſhall enjoy a fullneſs of glory in compariſon of them, how ſhould we wait all the days of our appointed time, till our change ſhall come? This expectation of the Creature ſhould teach the godly (whoſe duty it is to expect) to long for, to haſten to the manifeſtation of this glory: <hi>Solomon</hi> ſends the Sluggard to the Piſmire, and bids him learn of him diligence and induſtry; the ſame may be ſaid to the godly man; Go to the Creature thou dull and ſloathful man, and learn of the Creature to look for, and to be more and more in expectation of the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thine own glory.</p>
                  <p>The Creatures expect when you ſhall be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in glory: is it not a ſhame then to thoſe who are Sons and Heirs of glory, not to expect their own glory? the Creatures lift up their eyes to Heaven, crying, <hi>How long Lord!</hi> is it not a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52862:52"/> ſhame then to the Sons of God, that they ſhould caſt their eyes down to the Earth, on the glory of it which paſſeth away like a Flower of the Field? The creatures put forth their heads, and cry, why are the wheels of the Chariot ſo long in coming? is it not a ſhame then for the Sons of God to hang their heads down? is it not a ſhame to us, that ſenceleſs creatures ſhould be earneſt, and we ſlack in our expectation? ſhall ſenceleſs creatures outſtrip thoſe who are endued with reaſon and grace? ſhall their hope outſtrip our hope? If you believe there ſhall be ſuch a manifeſtation, and that you in particular ſhall be manifeſted to be the Sons of God, ſhew me your faith by your earneſt expectation; you have but poor deſires of Chriſt's coming, and your own glory, whoſe expectation is ſo cold and faint: if the creatures were to be partakers of that very glory that you ſhall be, how much more earneſt would they be in expecting the manifeſtation of it? the very cauſe why we do not more earneſtly expect our glorious manifeſtation, is our earthly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedneſs; we mind Earth ſo much, therefore do we expect Heaven ſo little.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Sheweth there is no compariſon, or equality, between a Believer's preſent ſufferings, and his future glory.</head>

                  <head>SECT. I.</head>
                  <p>THe next Propoſition I ſhall lay down from this Text, is, that there is no compariſon, proportion, or equality, between the preſent ſufferings of the Saints, and their glory that ſhall be revealed; their preſent afflictions are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be laid in the ballance with glory; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons between them are odious: we ſhould not ſpeak of our afflictions on that day we ſpeak of glory. That there is no compariſon, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between them, will appear, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the enſuing particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. If you look at the things themſelves which you ſuffer for the preſent, and what you ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy hereafter, there is no more compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, then there is between a Mole-hill and the Sun; a drop, and the ſea of Water; a little pibble, and a rock of Diamonds.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You ſuffer perhaps the loſs of goods; you ſhall enjoy God who is all goodneſs; what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon is there betwixt the Creature and the Creator? all the Nations of the World are but as a drop of a Bucket before him; what then are thy goods, thy riches to God himſelf?</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:52862:53"/>2. Suppoſe you ſuffer the loſs of Houſes and Lands, you ſhall poſſeſs a great Kingdom; <hi>fear not, little flock, it is your Father's pleaſure to give you a Kingdom:</hi> what compariſon is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thy earthly poſſeſſions and that heavenly Kingdom? the whole Earth in compariſon of the Heavens is but a point; what are thy Houſes and Lands to that heavenly Kingdom?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Do you ſuffer mockings, revilings, evil ſpeakings, reproaches before men, and from men? Chriſt will confeſs you before his Father, and before his holy Angels: what are mens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings and defamations, to the confeſſion of Chriſt before an innumerable company of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Angels?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Perhaps you ſuffer impriſonment, you may lie in naſty dungeons, your feet may be in the ſtocks, your hands manacled, what are theſe things to the glorious liberty of the Sons of God which they ſhall enjoy, when you ſhall walk at large in Heaven, and follow the Lamb where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he goeth? here ye are mens Priſoners, there ye ſhall be the Lord's Free-men; here ye are fettered Captives, there you ſhall be crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Kings.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. You may ſuffer preſent baniſhment from your Country, from your Wives, Children, Parents, Kinred, Friends; in Heaven you ſhall enjoy communion and fellowſhip with God, with Chriſt, with an innumerable Company of Angels, with the general Aſſembly of the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52862:53"/> Firſt-born, and live among all glorious Saints.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. For the preſent you may ſuffer much ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, tears may be your meat and drink conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually; but what is your preſent ſorrow to the joy of the Lord, to the comforts of Heaven, one drop of which falling down from Heaven on the Soul of a Believer, makes him for the preſent to rejoyce with glorious and unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able joy? what are your dropping tears to the rivers of pleaſure which are at God's right hand.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. At preſent you may be put to ſhame and confuſion; men may ſet crowns of paper upon your heads, having Devils painted on them, as they did upon <hi>John Huſs;</hi> or you may have crowns of ſtraw put upon your heads in deriſion, as ſome other Martyrs; or crowns of thorns, as Chriſt had; but what is this to the Crown of Glory, the Crown of Righteouſneſs, the Crown of Immortality, which Chriſt the righteous Judg will ſet upon your heads?</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Put caſe you ſuffer death for Chriſt, of which cup many millions of Heavens Worthies have drunk; put caſe it be a ſhameful torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death, a burning, a ſawing aſunder, ye are ſtoned, or buried alive, or ſtarved to death, or torn in pieces by Lions, whatſoever the death be, 'tis the worſt of evils you can ſuffer for Chriſt; yet what compariſon is there between this death, and that life which you ſhall live in Heaven? Had you as many lives as hairs on your heads, (as a Martyr wiſhed he had) had you millions
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52862:54"/> of lives to loſe for Chriſt, yet the loſs of all theſe are not worthy to be compared to the life which ſuffering Chriſtians ſhall live in Heaven; put all together, and you ſhall ſee there is no compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon between your preſent ſufferings, and your future enjoyments of good: See what Chriſt ſaith <hi>Mark</hi> 10.29, 30. <hi>There is no man that hath left Houſe, or Brethren, or Siſters, or Father, or Mother, or Wife, or Children, or Lands, for my ſake and the Goſpels, but he ſhall receive an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred-fold now in this time,</hi> &amp;c. There is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon between your preſent loſſes and preſent gains, your preſent ſufferings and preſent reward; your preſent reward is an hundred-fold more then all you can loſe; the grace of God is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the ſavour of God is preſent; the right to Heaven which Believers have for the preſent, is far above all their preſent ſufferings: Now if the reward which ſuffering Chriſtians have in this life be an hundred-fold better then their ſufferings, then doubtleſs their glory in Heaven ſhall be a thouſand-fold more tranſcendent.</p>

                  <head>SECT. II.</head>
                  <p n="2">II. THere is no proportion or compariſon, if you reſpect the properties of our preſent ſufferings, and our future glory.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is no compariſon between earthly and heavenly things; your preſent ſufferings are earthly; the goods of which you are ſpoiled
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52862:54"/> are earthly; your liberty, your houſes, your lives, your joys, your eaſe, are earthly things, but your glory is heavenly; every part, every degree of your future glory is heavenly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is no proportion between that which is tranſient, paſſing away, and cannot endure, and that which is permanent, enduring; your preſent ſufferings are tranſient, they paſs away, they endure not. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſaid of perſecution, <hi>Nubecula est, quae cito tranſiret.</hi> There is nothing more tranſient and ſwift then time; your ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings paſs away together with time, they cannot endure always; all you which are the ſubject of them ſhall not endure always; now your glory is permanent, it ſhall abide and endure when time ſhall be no more.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is no proportion or compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a moment and eternity; a moment, a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, and for ever and ever: your preſent ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are but for a moment, a ſhort ſpace of time, your glory is eternal, for ever and for ever; your pain and torment is but for a moment, your eaſe and reſt is for ever and ever; your ſuffering im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment is but for a moment, your glorious liberty is eternal; you ſuffer death but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, your life is eternal; what compariſon is there between the twinkling of an eye and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? You ſay you have ſuffered long, as <hi>Aſaph,</hi> you are plagued every morning; you have been in bitterneſs all your days, ever ſince you began to look after Heaven, you have been afflicted
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52862:55"/> from your youth up to your age, even to the day of your death: Grant all this to be true, yet thy whole life is but a moment compared to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the ſufferings of a thouſand years is but a moment to eternity; yea, millions of years are but a moment compared to eternity; nor will they paſs for ſo much, if we did but conſider what eternity is.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is no compariſon between light things and heavy; between a feather and a rock, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween chaff and a mountain of lead; your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent afflictions are light, your future glory is pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous and weighty, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. obſerve what a moſt elegant oppoſition the Apoſtle makes, he oppoſeth glory to afflictions; he oppoſeth eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to momentany; he oppoſeth weight to light: and he addeth a moſt tranſcendent expreſſion, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: we tranſlate it, <hi>A far more exceeding weight of glory.</hi> Some, by adding ſome other words, do give this ſenſe, Our afflictions are out of meaſure moment any, our glory is out of meaſure eternal; our afflictions are out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure light, our glory is out of meaſure weighty. Whatſoever your afflictions are, and how grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſoever they are in themſelves, and how long ſoever, yet they are but light being compared with the glory of Heaven, and with the weight of it: If you look only on your ſufferings, and judge of them according to your ſenſe, ſo they are not light; but judge of them as oppoſed to future glory, and ſo they are out of meaſure no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:52862:55"/>5. Afflictions do not ſeize on us at all times; Chriſtians have their <hi>lucida intervalla,</hi> their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of eaſe, as well as their moments of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, their preſent times of rejoycing, as well as their preſent times and <hi>Now's</hi> of ſorrowing; they, even they have their times to ſing and dance, as their times to weep and mourn: <hi>Paul</hi> had his raptures as well as his preſſures: <hi>David</hi> had his time to play on the Harp, as times to hang it up, and there is no Chriſtian that is afflicted at all times, they have their ſad Eclipſes but now and then: but now their glory ſhall be at all and every moment during eternity; they ſhall have perpetual glory without one moment of ſhame, perpetual joy without one moment of ſorrow; God will wipe away all tears from their eyes, they ſhall continually ſing for ſuperabundant joy of Soul and Body, their eyes ſhall ever ſee God, they ſhall not ſee ſorrow any more, they ſhall be as the Angels of God, who never felt ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſince their Creation; they ſhall be as very ſtrangers to ſorrow, as the Damned ſhall be to joy: this preſent time ſhall be no more, then the afflictions of this preſent time ſhall be no more. That was an arrogant and falſe ſelf-deceiving ſpeech of <hi>Babilon: Lo, I ſit as a Queen, and ſhall ſee no more ſorrow.</hi> The godly, when taken up into glory, ſhall ſay it truly; now we ſit as Kings, and ſhall not ſee any ſorrow, no not for a moment whilſt eternity laſteth: Eternity is nothing elſe but a perpetual moment of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52862:56"/> and glorious joy and happineſs.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. There is no proportion, becauſe afflictions are juſtly due: are ye hated of all men? ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, and more, ye deſerve to be hated of God, of his Angels for ever: Are ye caſt by men into Priſon, into Dungeons? ye deſerve it and more, even to be caſt into Hell fire: are ye ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from your Countrey, friends, and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? you deſerve that and more, ye deſerve to be baniſhed from Heaven, from your God, from your Saviour to Eternity. Are ye ſpoiled of your goods? ye deſerve it, and more, even to be ſpoiled of eternal mercies, of eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Are your bodies condemned to be burnt, or to be caſt to Lyons and wild Beaſts to tear them to pieces? you deſerve this and more, even to have both body and Soul condemned to Hell fire, to be caſt to Devils to be devoured: ye that ſin daily, deſerve to ſuffer daily; ye that have ſin in you, you do deſerve that all plagues, miſeries, curſes, deaths, ſhould make a prey on your Souls and bodies; but glory is altogether undue, the meer and free gift of God in Chriſt: your Title to it is of meer grace, ſo ſhall be your Poſſeſſion of it, meer grace: you were Elected to glory, Redeemed to glory, Called to glory, engrafted into Chriſt by faith, and ſo become heirs of glory, before you ſuffered any thing for Chriſt. True it is! God hath made our ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings a condition of the Promiſe of glory; it is of his own meer pleaſure to ordain our ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52862:56"/> to be the condition of glory: I may ſay of this condition, as <hi>Naaman</hi>'s ſervant ſaid to him, murmuring at the Prophet, bidding him go waſh in <hi>Jordan</hi> and be clean; <hi>My Lord! if the Prophet had bid thee do a greater thing, wouldeſt thou not have done it; how much more, ſeeing he ſaith, waſh and be clean?</hi> ſo had God required of us harder conditions, Go ſuffer Hell torments for Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of years, and afterward you ſhall be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſhould not we do it? but now when he requireth and commandeth us to ſuffer afflictions but for this preſent time, but for a moment, but for a ſhort life in the World, ſhall not we cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly and cheerfully ſuffer with Chriſt for this preſent time?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. There is no compariſon between afflictions and future glory, if we conſider the ſubject of both; the ſubject of afflictions is either our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies or our eſtates, liberties, only outward things; not the Soul: <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf hath no power over that, ſaid the Martyr to his Perſecutors: So ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Fear not them that can kill the Body;</hi> they can (when God permits) kill thy Body, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon thy Body, ſpoil thee of thy goods, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thy Body to hunger, cold, nakedneſs, and ſuch like outward evils, but as for thy Soul, the wrath, the malice of men cannot reach it: But now the ſubject of glory is both Soul and Body; unſpeakable glory ſhall be revealed in your Souls and in your Bodies; God kills the Souls and Bodies of the Wicked, and he will ſave the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52862:57"/> Souls and Bodies of his People; God will fill the Souls of Believers with knowledg, pureneſs, and joy, and their Bodies with immortality and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptibility, and Sun-like ſplendour; ſo that they ſuffer but in part, but ſhall be glorified in the whole; they ſuffer but in theſe vile Bodies, which are by nature mortal, and becauſe of ſin ſubject to miſery, but both Soul and Body muſt partake in glory.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. There is no compariſon between them, if we regard the meaſure and degrees of our ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the degrees and meaſure of future glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: no Chriſtian ſuffereth in the higheſt degree, God is pleaſed to mitigate their ſufferings, and to reſtrain the rage of their Enemies, that they cannot, they ſhall not act according to their wills; he that ſuffereth moſt may ſuffer more; but fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture glory ſhall be in the higheſt degree, to the utmoſt, as far as our natures are capable. The meaſure of our ſufferings is not full, preſſed down, and running over, but the meaſure of glory ſhall be full, preſſed down, and running over; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle in the ſame fore-cited place, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. ſaith, that our glory ſhall be far more exceeding weighty: Obſerve the grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It ſhall be weighty, when as afflictions in the higheſt degree are but light.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Glory ſhall be exceeding weighty, beyond the weight of our afflictions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As if this were too little, he addeth [ſhall be more exceeding weighty.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:52862:57"/>4. As if this were too little, he addeth the word [far] ſhall be far more exceeding weighty. The Apoſtle uſeth theſe words, becauſe he could not expreſs the ultimate degrees of that glory which ſhall be revealed in ſuffering Chriſtians; the future happineſs of Believers paſſeth all ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance and underſtanding.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. There is no compariſon, if we conſider how that we ſuffer but ſome one, or ſome few evils, but in Heaven we ſhall receive all kinds of goods, all kinds and degrees; God gives out ſufferings by parcels, but glory in the groſs, or lump; ſome he permits to be tortured, others to be mocked, others to be impriſoned,<note place="margin">Heb 11.35, 36, 37, 38.</note> others to be ſtoned; ſome to be ſawn in ſunder, others to wander hither and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be deſtitute of neceſſaries; ſome ſuffer one kind of evil, others another, one doth not ſuffer all; but now their future glory is made up of all that goodneſs which God in his wiſdom knows conducible to make them eternally bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: <hi>Oh how great is that goodneſs which thou haſt laid up for them that love thee!</hi> cries <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 31.19. He gives them drops of ſorrow, ſeas of joy and comfort; he gives them ſparks of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and gives them a Sun full of glory: what goodneſs is in Heaven, is for their happineſs. God placed in Paradiſe trees of all ſorts for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s delight: Heaven is God's own Paradiſe, there is nothing wanting there for delight and bleſſedneſs: In a word, God himſelf will be
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52862:58"/> their glory, he will be all in all to them; his own joy, his own glory, his own comfort and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall be theirs, they ſhall then need nothing.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Conſider this one thing, and you will ſee there is no compariſon between them; the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of this preſent time are common to wicked and godly; they ſuffer the ſame evils from men, but for different cauſes; the wicked ſuffer as evil doers, the godly ſuffer for doing well. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of afflictions St. <hi>Paul</hi> brings as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to perſwade Chriſtians to bear the burthen patiently; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>There is no temptation hath taken you, but ſuch as is common to man.</hi> Look over your afflictions under which you groan, and you ſhall ſee other men under the ſame burthen with you: But now this future glory is a Believers peculiar portion; wicked men may drink of the cup of their ſufferings, but ſhall not have one drop of their joys; they may endure cruel mockings, but ſhall never ſhare with them in honour; that glory is peculiar to the Saints, reſerved only for Believers, makes it the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable: Put caſe the light of the Sun were but for ſome men, and all the reſt lived and walked in darkneſs, we ſhould judge the ſtate of ſuch men incomparably comfortable above others; the glory of Heaven is peculiar to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, the darkneſs of affliction is common to Unbelievers with them, in this reſpect there is no compariſon.</p>

My Brethren, <hi>count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations:</hi> Do not only count it joy, but count it <hi>all joy;</hi> joy in nothing more then in this, joy only in this, <hi>when ye fall into temptations]</hi> that is, afflictions. A ſtrange exhortation to a carnal heart! what! is it all joy to be mocked, reviled, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, hated, impriſoned, tortured, to have our Bodies bound at ſtakes? ſhould it not rather be ſaid, Count this a cauſe of weeping, ſighing, wringing of hands? No, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>count it all joy,</hi> when trouble cometh upon trouble, wave upon wave, ſtorm upon ſtorm; when the winds blow, and the rain falls, and the waves beat upon you, then count it all joy; call upon your ſouls to rejoyce, call upon your hearts to Magnifie God, clap your hands, leap for joy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It informs us that they are the happy ones of the Earth, who are the greateſt ſufferers for Righteouſneſs ſake: thus St. <hi>James</hi> Chap. 1.2. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that endureth temptation,</hi> or tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation. <hi>James</hi> 5.11. <hi>Behold, we count them happy which endure,</hi> ſaith the ſame Apoſtle. What a paradox is this to a man that mindeth earthly things! Call you him bleſſed that is impriſoned,

Yes, ſaith the Apoſtle, he is a bleſſed man: we count him happy whom all men hate, who ſuffer hunger, cold, nakedneſs, impriſonment, death, baniſhment for the name of Chriſt; we count him happy who endures moſt miſery with and for Chriſt; we count him, and him only a miſerable man, that can laugh and ſing away care and ſorrow, who ſits like a Queen and ſees no ſorrow, who fares deliciouſly every day, who can eat, drink, and play, and ſo paſs his time of life away, he is a miſerable man: For 'tis not what a man is for the preſent, which makes him happy or miſerable, but what a man ſhall be to eternity; he that is miſerable for the preſent, but ſhall be happy to eternity, we count him happy; and he that is happy for the preſent time, but ſhall be miſerable to eternity, we count him a curſed man. <hi>Lazarus</hi> in the depth of his miſery was an happy man, becauſe he is glorious to all eternity; the rich Glutton was a miſerable wretch in the height of his jollity, becauſe he is miſerable to eternity.</p>
               <p>Hence I conclude, that the glory that ſhall be revealed in us, will make us perfectly bleſſed; but our preſent ſufferings cannot make us miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, for the Saints are happy in the thickeſt of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52862:59"/> them, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.11, 12. Then doth the Spirit of God and of glory reſt upon them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. Our preſent miſeries at the uttermoſt can but rob us of a temporal life, which will (come they or come they not) fail us at length; but glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows upon us, and crowns us with an everlaſting bliſsful life. He that hath an intereſt in Chriſt, may cry out with that great Apoſtle, <hi>What ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt?</hi> and may ſay, I am perſwaded, that neither Death with its terrours, nor life with its charmes, neither Angels with their beauties, nor Devils with their defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, things preſent with their allurements, things future with their promiſes or threatnings, nor Hell with its torments, can ever ſeparate me from the love of God in Chriſt: and indeed how ſhould they, ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine;</hi> becauſe death (though never ſo hideous) leads us to him; life is found in his poſſeſſion; Angels and Devils are the Miniſters of his juſtice or his mercy; things preſent are falſe, things to come uncertain: Hell with God would be our happineſs, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven without him would be our torment: or we may ſay again with the ſame Father: that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can ſeparate a Chriſtian from Jeſus Chriſt, and make him miſerable: <hi>Not death,</hi> becauſe there is no Chriſtian can be brought into ſo diſmal an eſtate as to be deprived of his love: <hi>not the Angels,</hi> becauſe being united to Chriſt, we are ſtronger then all Spirits combined together againſt us: <hi>not the vexations of life,</hi> becauſe they
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52862:60"/> are ſweet, when undergone for his honour, and ſerve only to give us a nearer conjunction to his perſon: <hi>Not things to come,</hi> becauſe nothing can be beſtowed, nor promiſed which can counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail him: <hi>Not Heaven,</hi> becauſe it is the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of them that ſerve him: <hi>Not Hell,</hi> becauſe it is made for none but thoſe that forſake him: by all which we ſee, that a man firmly united to Chriſt, cannot by theſe outward things be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from him.</p>
               <p>Oh the ſolidity, perſpicuity, and ſelf-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of that Paradiſe and place of delights, of that Celeſtial company, and Crowned ſociety! who is able to expreſs the comfort and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that eſtate and condition, where we ſhall have all bleſſedneſs Internal, External, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal? what can be done or ſuffered to anſwer ſo great a reward? the diſeaſed will endure the cutting and ſearing of their Members for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of a ſhort tedious life: <hi>Heathens</hi> have ſuffered great things for a little vain glory: if they prize the ſhadow ſo much, at what rate ſhould we value the ſubſtance? what are a few drops of blood for the Kingdom of Heaven? how may this comfort us under afflictions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the afflictions of this life are but ſmall ſhowers, at the moſt but ſome ſhort ſtorms, which are followed with an Eternal calm, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.8.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Circumſtances are two; <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place:</hi> as for the Time it ſhall be,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the day of the Creatures Reſtoration: we read, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.21. <hi>That the Heavens muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain Chriſt until the time of the reſtitution of all things:</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>That the Creature
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52862:61"/> it ſelf alſo ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the Sons of God,</hi> Rom. 8.21. Here divers queſtions are to be propounded.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>What Creatures are to be delivered into this glorious liberty?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> 1. Under this word <hi>[Creature]</hi> we are not to compriſe the Elect Angels, becauſe never ſubject to vanity; nor the reprobate Angels and Men, becauſe they are deſtroyed with an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deſtruction from the preſence of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neither are we to compriſe the godly Elect men under this Word <hi>[Creature]</hi> in this place; for although it be moſt true, that all the godly ſhall be perfectly delivered from all manner of bondage into perfect liberty; yet, St. <hi>Paul</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the Creatures to the Elect, in thoſe words <hi>[Not only they, but we alſo.]</hi> And the glorious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Sons of God, is the State into which the Creatures are to be delivered, according to their capacity, the future glory of the Sons of God being the exemplar of the Creatures glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; the Elect are to be delivered primarily, the Creatures ſecondarily; the Elect are not meant.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By <hi>Creature,</hi> we are not to underſtand thoſe Creatures which are bred of dung and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, the excrements of Nature: neither are we to underſtand thoſe Creatures which are the effects of God's Curſe upon the Creature, as a penalty of man's Tranſgreſſion, as Thornes, Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52862:61"/> Briars, and ſuch like, theſe ſhall be turned into nothing: but,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By Creatures we are to underſtand the Heavens and the Earth, and Elements, and all the Works of God, which he made at firſt very good in themſelves, wherein his glory did much appear, and were for the great delight, content, and neceſſary uſe of man, as living Creatures; the Fowles which are the Hoſt and ornament of Heaven; the Beaſts, and all Plants, which are the Hoſt and ornament of the Earth: Theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be given for this opinion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe the Apoſtle <hi>ver.</hi> 19. ſpeaks indefinitely <hi>[the Creature.]</hi> Likewiſe in <hi>ver.</hi> 20.21. But <hi>ver.</hi> 22. as if he would put all out of doubt, he ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the whole Creation, or <hi>omnis Creatura,</hi> as it is in the margin of your Bibles: this is a known rule of interpreting Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when there are many words of one and the ſame thing, the latter are the Interpretation of the former.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe all the Creatures which in the day of Creation were very good, are all equally ſubject to bondage, to vanity and corruption, and all the Creatures do deſire their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and preſervation as well as ſome Creatures; there is no reaſon why ſome ſhould be fruſtrated of theſe their natural deſires, and others ſhould not.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe they who hold that only the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the Earth ſhall be renewed, and not
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52862:62"/> other Creatures, cannot without reaſon conceive, that the Heavens, Earth, and Elements can be without their ornaments; if ſo, then the Earth would be under greater bondage of vanity then now it is, it ſhould then be void of all form and beauty: now the reaſons which they give for their opinion is, becauſe theſe, and not other parts of the World, are only capable of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality: But to this I anſwer, that no Creature is in its own nature capable of Immortality; the Heavens and the Earth are not: Immortality is the meer gift of God, and depends not on any thing in Nature; therefore if the Heavens, Earth, Elements, ſhall be reſtored to an Immortal State, as the Schoolmen think, God who gives them Immo tallity, may allow the ſame benefit to the other parts of the World for his own glory, as unto them; all being capable of the gift of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, if God beſtow it.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Some conceive that the deliverance of the Creation from this bondage is by a total abolition and deſtruction of the whole Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52862:62"/> the Creature being made for man <hi>quatenus viator, non comprehenſor;</hi>

                  <p>Divers Arguments are brought for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation hereof, chiefly from the uſeleſsneſs of the Creature in that eſtate; when Man ſhall have no more need of the Creatures, why ſhould they be any more? what uſe will there be of the Sun
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52862:63"/> or Stars to enlighten him? The Scripture ſaith, in Heaven <hi>there ſhall be no night,</hi> and thoſe that are there <hi>need no Candle, neither light of the Sun; for the Lord giveth them light,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.5. There ſhall be no need (ſay they) of Earth or Water for the refreſhment and uſe of Man, of no Beaſts or Fowls to feed on, of none of the Creatures to ſerve him; when Man ſhall have a ſpiritual Body, and be raiſed to an incorruptible ſtate, he will be far above the uſe of theſe things; therefore (ſay they) why ſhould theſe things be, that will be of no uſe at all? Moreover, the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of theſe men is, that after God hath by fire deſtroyed this preſent World, then will he either out of nothing, or out of the aſhes, create new Heavens and new Earth; according to that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13. which is expreſſed in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.22.</p>

                  <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T what is that glory whereof the Creatures ſhall be partakers, or into which they ſhall be delivered?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> 1. This we may with confidence aſſert, that the whole Creation ſhall be reduced to a moſt happy ſtate, beyond what they were in the day of their Creation: they were ſeen very good, very pleaſing, beautiful, uſeful, all filled with ſo much goodneſs, as that man could have drawn much contentment from them; but now ſhall be made better, more beautiful, more excellent.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They ſhall have as much goodneſs reſtored to them, as ſhall fully fit and accommodate them for the ſtate of glorious liberty, and for glorious perſons: what that goodneſs ſhall be 'tis ſafeſt to ſay we know not: it will then appear when God ſhall effect their deliverance.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The glory with which God will cloathe the whole Creation ſhall be to the capacity of each Creatures nature.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. No Creature ſhall partake of that glory
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52862:65"/> which is proper to the Children of God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they capable of that glory whereof the godly are.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. 4. <hi>To what uſe ſhall the Creatures deckt with glory ſerve?</hi> This queſtion is the ſtone of ſtumbling at which many Divines ſtumble, and ſo fall into a flat denial of his glorious Renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Creatures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> They ſhall not be for ſuch uſes as now they are: this preſent World of Creatures are principally for theſe two ends.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the ſuſtentation of theſe our bodies, and the preſervation of this Animal life we now live: they are for Food, for Rayment, for Phyſick, for bodily delights.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Their other uſe and end is, that the minds of men may take their riſe from the Creatures excellencies, to mount up into an holy contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of God: the viſible Creatures teach man ſome knowledge of the inviſible God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. Their excellencies do make known to us the infinite Wiſdom, Power, and goodneſs of God; but the Creatures, when thus delivered into a State of glory ſhall not be for theſe ends; for,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then our lives ſhall not be Animal, and our bodies ſhall not be ſubject to hunger, thirſt, cold, heat, and ſuch like natural infirmities, our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhall be ſpiritualized, and ſhall no more need theſe things to preſerve them then the Angels: as in the Reſurrection we ſhall neither marry, nor be given in marriage; ſo neither ſhall we eat,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52862:66"/> drink, or feel the pinching cold, or faint with ſcorching heat; therefore the Creature ſhall not ſerve for this uſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, the Creatures ſhall no more teach man the knowledge of God, becauſe then we ſhall ſee him face to face, without looking through the glaſs of the Creatures; God will then immediately communicate himſelf to us, that we ſhall know him as we are known.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But even in the ſtate of glory we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee God with our bodily eyes; therefore leſt our bodily eyes ſhould be deſtitute of an apt delightſome object, the glory which God will put on the Creature will be the delight of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified eyes, then we ſhall be raviſhed with the infinite Wiſdom and Power of God in inveſting the whole Creation with ſuch glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> Though this is probably true, that the glorified Saints ſhall delight in beholding the glory of the Creatures, and ſhall admire God in their glory, yet if there ſhould be no Renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Creature, there would be moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable objects for the glorified Saints to behold, as namely,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt's glorified Body, the brightneſs whereof will obſcure the brightneſs of Sun, Moon, and Stars, as the brightneſs of the Sun puts out the light of the Fire; and in this reſpect it is ſaid, there ſhall be no need neither of the Sun, nor of the Moon to ſhine in heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.23.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As Chriſt's body, ſo likewiſe the glorious
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52862:66"/> bodies of all the Elect ſhall be the delight of their eyes, which ſhall ſhine more bright then the Sun: What delight then can the Creatures cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with glory bring? and in beholding the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Saints in glory, we may behold the infinite Wiſdom, Power, Love, Grace of God, in making handfuls of Duſt and Earth ſuch glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Creatures, as our bodies then ſhall be. Yet we may rationally aſſert,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God will ordain the Creature to ſome uſe; it is not to be imagined that the Creatures ſhall continue after the day of Judgment, and yet not ſerve to ſome uſe: if you ask to what uſe, <hi>Lombard</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. Doubtleſs God will adapt and fit the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the uſe of the glorified ſtate of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (as was hinted before) which they ſhall then fully and perfectly know when they ſhall be actual poſſeſſors of the new Heavens and new Earth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Learned <hi>Bain</hi> gives this anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It may be God will have the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſtand as a Monument of his former Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52862:67"/> Wiſdom, and Goodneſs to his people in the day of their Pilgrimage on Earth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or God will have them ſtand for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Majeſty, meerly for greater State; as we ſee it is a State belonging to Earthly Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to have ſumptuous Houſes here and there, which yet they do not once viſit in all their Reigns.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God will have them ſtand as appurtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the glory of his own Children; the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhall be kept as additions to their honour, ſaith <hi>Calvin. Chryſoſtome</hi>

And think how ſweet Heaven will be to one that hath had ſuch a hard paſſage thither: <hi>Through labours more abundant, ſtripes above meaſure, many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, chains, fetters, whippings, ſcourgings, ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracks, deaths, journeyings, perills of Waters, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries by his own Countrey-men, by the Heathen.</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:52862:70"/> True it is, he gives in a large bill of his charges, as it were; but when he cometh to ſpeak of his wages, he makes nothing of his labours and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings in compariſon of the reward, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. <hi>For theſe light and momentany afflictions do work out for us an exceeding eternal weight of glory.</hi> The higheſt Mountain in the World is very light in compariſon of the whole Earth; even ſo are the greateſt afflictions of the greateſt ſufferers in compariſon of the glory of Heaven.

That <hi>he ſaw that reſt was good, and that the Land was pleaſant, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he put his ſhoulders to labour, and became ſervant to Tribute:</hi> So I may ſay, the reſt and glory of the Saints is good, but the Land that brings forth this reſt, will be beſt and moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to them after all their labours and ſufferings are fully ended; then to receive this glorious reſt, will be moſt ſweet unto them, and moſt ſeaſonable.</p>
               <p>Were Heaven nothing elſe but an Haven of reſt we know how welcome the one is to a Sea ſick weather-beaten Traveller: and by that we may conceive how welcome the other will be to a Soul that hath been long toſſed in the Waves of this troubleſom World, ſick of its own ſinful imaginations, and tyred out with outward temptations: the happieſt Soul that ever hath ſailed over this <hi>Euripus,</hi> in the beſt Ship, in the moſt healthful body that ever was, never had

The Earth is beautiful, eſpecially in the prime of the Spring and Summer, when the face of it is renewed; but yet when it is in its greateſt glory, it is but a dunghil in compariſon of the Heavens. That glory of the Heavens which we ſee on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and afar off, is incomparably beyond the beauty of the things below; but that which we cannot ſee, doth far ſurmount that which we do ſee; I mean that moſt glorious habitation of the Angels and Saints; though that which we behold hath incomparably more beauty and glory in it, then our weak ſight can diſcern at ſuch a diſtance: and therefore the Heavens, for their ſurpaſſing beauty and glory, are called the Houſe of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As a Man is commonly to be ſeen at his own houſe, more then at another place beſides; ſo doth the Lord in Heaven more eſpecially ſhew forth his glory. The Lord hath been but ſeldom manifeſted on the Earth, as when he gave ſo many viſible ſigns of his glorious preſence upon Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> and then when <hi>Moſes</hi> was admitted to ſee his back parts; and when he ſpake from Heaven at the Baptiſm of our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>This is my beloved Son,</hi> &amp;c. but in Heaven his preſence is more notably manifeſted continually; our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſheweth, that in Heaven the holy Angels do always behold the face of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.10. his glorious preſence is always manifeſted there.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In a Man's dwelling houſe, uſually his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants are abiding; and although
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52862:72"/> Kings and Princes have more Servants and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers then an houſe can hold, yet their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Attendants are commonly with them in the Court: ſo Heaven is the place appointed for the Lord's Servants, though all of them are not yet there; not for want of room, but becauſe the Lord hath appointed them other work to do elſewhere for a time; yet thither ſhall they be gathered, and in the mean time there are his principal Attendants, there are the glorious Angels, who are called the Angels of Heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.36. there alſo are the bleſſed Saints of God departed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As a Man's houſe wherein he dwelleth is furniſhed for the moſt part, ſo that his riches appear (in ſome ſort) in his houſe; ſo Heaven is the place which is moſt royally furniſhed; the Earth is but a Country Farm-houſe in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of it: Heaven is richly adorned and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with perfect Holineſs; all the Veſſels of that Houſe are of pure Gold; there is neither droſs in them, nor any uncleanneſs cleaving to them; all the Saints and Angels there are free from all impurity; no unclean thing hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into this houſe of God: <hi>Holineſs becometh thine houſe, O Lord for ever,</hi> Pſal. 93.5. it is full of all holineſs and happineſs. It is ſaid <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.25. that <hi>the Gates of Heaven ſhall not be ſhut at all.</hi> Heaven Gates ſhall always ſtand open, yet no unclean thing ſhall enter in. The Streets of that City are of pure Gold, the walls built of precious Stones,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:52862:73"/> there are twelve Gates of twelve Pearls. A good Expoſitor obſerveth, that all thoſe precious Stones there mentioned, have a contrary virtue againſt uncleanneſs, to ſhew unto us, that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will not admit of any impure and defiled thing; God will not ſuffer the dirty feet of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Sinners to tread upon his pure Pavement of Gold. When God drave ſinful <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe, he cauſed a <hi>Cherubim</hi> to ſtand before the Gates of Paradiſe, with a flaming ſword in his hand, to keep him out of Paradiſe if he ſhould attempt to come in again. Sin is like the ſword of the flaming Cherubim, to keep out all wicked men from entring into Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Heaven is alſo a place of holy Exerciſes. Here our beſt ſervices are ſtained with ſin, and tainted with corruption; but there all the ſervices of the Saints do bear a lively impreſſion of the fountain of holineſs upon them; there they muſt warble forth the Song of the <hi>Seraphims, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,</hi> Iſai. 6.3. It is ſaid of the Saints of God in glory, that they ſhall be Prieſts of God and Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.6. As they are all made ſpiritual Kings and Prieſts to God on Earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. ſo they ſhall be Prieſts to God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and reign with him for ever and ever. They ſhall be Prieſts to God two ways in Heaven. Firſt, As ſoon as they leave this life, in the <hi>interim,</hi> before the ſecond coming of Chriſt, they ſhall perform the offices of Prieſts in Soul only, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God the ſacrifice of praiſe and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52862:73"/> that themſelves are already delivered out of the miſeries of this World, and praying for their Brethren upon the Earth, that they may ſhortly be delivered: For ſo St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, that he ſaw under the Altar the Souls of thoſe that were ſlain for the word of God, and for the teſtimony which they held, crying out with a loud voice, <hi>How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost not thou avenge our blood upon them that dwell on the Earth?</hi> Rom. 6.9, 10. And ſecondly, at Chriſt's ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, both they that are deceaſed already, and they that ſhall then be found alive, ſhall joyntly and joyfully ſing, <hi>Hallelujah, ſalvation, and glory, and honour, and power unto the Lord our God, for true and righteous are his judgments,</hi> Rev. 19.1, 2. and <hi>v.</hi> 6. St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, he heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, ſaying, <hi>Hallelujah, for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth; let us be glad and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and give honour to him, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his Wife hath made her ſelf ready.</hi> The high praiſes of God ſhall then be in the mouthes of all his Saints; being now made perfect in holineſs, and freed from all frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they ſhall never mourn, but ever ſing and laud their Redeemer without defatigation or ſatiety.</p>
                  <p>But to paſs by this, it is needful in few words to ſhew, how the Heavens cannot properly be ſaid to be the houſe of God, as thoſe buildings wherein men dwell, are called their houſes, leaſt
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:52862:74"/> any ſhould be ſo ignorant as to entertain any vain thoughts not beſeeming the infinite Majeſty of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Heaven cannot contain and hold the infinite being of the Divine Nature, as the houſe holdeth him that dwelleth in it: Behold, the Heavens and the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain thee.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God hath no need of Heaven, either for reſt or ſafety, as a man hath of his houſe; he is not ſubject to wearineſs, no work is toilſome to him; he ſlumbereth not, ſleepeth not, he is above all dangers; one word of his mouth is enough to cruſh all Enemies to powder; he needeth not this Houſe as a Caſtle of defence unto him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He is not more eſſentially preſent there then in any other place, nor more abſent from any other place then from it, but every where alike eſſentially preſent, though there he giveth forth more glorious demonſtrations of his preſence then in any other place.</p>

                  <p>SEeing Heaven is God's houſe, then there ſhould our hearts be, even at home with our Father; how can we ſing the Lord's Song in a ſtrange Land? how can we pleaſe our ſelves ſo well in this houſe of our pilgrimage, when we are from home, thus far abſent from our Father's houſe? why are our minds ſo knit unto the earth, that nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ut leath will part it and us,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52862:74"/> as if not Heaven, but this lower ſinful part of the World were the Lord's dwelling place? with what face can we call him, our Father which is in Heaven, and in the mean time our ſtrongeſt and moſt hearty affections are deeply buried in the Earth? St. <hi>Paul</hi> was of another temper, <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be diſſolved</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and to be with Christ, which is best of all. — Best of all]</hi> ſo the bleſſed Apoſtle found and felt it; he ſpake out of a true diſcerning ſpirit, he ſpake as he found; he deſired Heaven for love of Chriſt, and not ſo much for love of his own eaſe and happineſs (though he could not but long for that alſo) but principally for love of Chriſt; therefore he long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to leave the Earth, and go to Heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that was the houſe of Chriſt, the houſe where God the Father ſheweth his glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; the houſe where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of the Majeſty on high. Oh that I were there, ſaith that holy Apoſtle, let me go through poverty, through perſecution, fire, ſword, ſtripes, impriſonment, and a thouſand deaths and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, ſo that I can but get unto my Saviour; it is beſt of all to be with him — what ſhall I ſay? better then to be with ſinful men; better then to be with a multitude of unruly corruptions cleaving to me: ſhall I ſay, better then to be in the midſt of heaps of Gold, or all manner of earthly abundance? I will not for the honour of my Saviour once bring him in compariſon with theſe dunghils and heaps of droſs; but it is beſt
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:52862:75"/> of all to be with him. It is better to be with him, then ſimply to be in Heaven it ſelf; it were better to be with him out of Heaven, then to be in Heaven without him, if that were poſſible: yea, if being with Chriſt were not ſalvation it ſelf, I would ſay, that to be with Chriſt were better then ſalvation, it is beſt of all.</p>
                  <p>Now then, when Heaven is thus glorious, when our deareſt Saviour, the King of glory, is entered within thoſe everlaſting doors, when it is the very houſe of God, how ſhould we long after it, that we might be with the Lord? what ſhame ſhould it caſt upon our faces, who have the Firſt-fruits of the Spirit? Is our Gaol now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more pleaſing to us then our Father's houſe? do we grow more and more earthly minded? Oh that we had more of Heaven in us to raiſe and draw our hearts thither, and leſs Earth to ſink us downward: let us pray and labour for more ſupernatural and heavenly affections; then we ſhall find our hearts riſing and lifted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, if Heaven be the houſe of God, and the place of his ſpecial preſence, this ſhould move us all to labour to be ſuch as may be fit for the preſence of God. Do we not all deſire to be in Heaven? alas, many of us do little conſider what Heaven is, or what it is to be in Heaven. It is true, that none (even thoſe that are moſt heavenly minded) can conſider of it according to its excellent glory; yet ſome there are, who
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:52862:75"/> though they cannot conceive it for the height of its excellency, yet they conceive the nature of it, though not the meaſure; they conceive of what kind, of what temper that glory and happineſs is which they ſhall receive, by that earneſt of the Spirit which they have received; as a man knoweth in what coyn he ſhall be paid, by that money which he hath received in earneſt already. But many others know not what Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven meaneth; how many are there that cannot now endure the preſence of God, and yet would fain be in Heaven? that hate this houſe of God, and yet long to be in that heavenly houſe of God? Aſſure thy ſelf, that unleſs thou couldeſt delight in God's preſence here, thou canſt have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in his preſence there: The happineſs of that houſe is heavenly and ſpiritual; there is nothing to pleaſe the covetous heart, nothing to fill the wanton eye, nothing to ſatisfie the Drunkard's and Glutton's appetite; no wanton dancing, no idle ſports, nothing but holineſs, and holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, and that glory which is the ornament of holineſs, and ariſeth from it: There is not a word, nor a thought, but what becometh the preſence of God, ſuch as abide his pure eyes. Now then, do thou (O Chriſtian) bend thy heart and ſoul toward this houſe and preſence of God, ſo ſhalt thou be a pillar in the houſe of God, and ſhalt go out of it no more, but ſhalt poſſeſs fulneſs of joy in his preſence for evermore.</p>

                  <p>NOw in this Houſe of God are many Manſions: <hi>In my Father's Houſe are many Manſions,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 14.2. Heaven is ſufficient to receive many Inhabitants; I mean not, that it is like ſome great Houſes that have no Inhabitants, but that it is appointed of God to be a dwelling place for many — Many, I ſay, not in compariſon of thoſe multitudes which ſhall be ſhut out of doors, but many in an abſolute conſideration taken by themſelves; yet theſe many ſhall be very few, in compariſon of the droves of men that throng together in the broad way of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Of the largeneſs of this Houſe of God, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaketh, when he compareth it with that Temple which he had built, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.27. <hi>Will God indeed dwell upon the Earth? behold, the Heaven, and the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain thee; how much leſs this Houſe which I have built?</hi> What do I ſpeak of the Lord's dwelling in this little Houſe which I have built? then he puts in a ſpecial note of attention and admiration, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, even thoſe large and ſpacious Heavens which himſelf hath builded, and ſpread out like a glorious curtain over the whole Earth, and all things between the Earth and it, cannot contain him; <hi>how much leſs this Houſe which I have made?</hi> As if he had ſaid, the Heavens are incompa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>bly greater then this Houſe which I have built, but
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52862:76"/> he is infinitely greater then the Heavens: Yea, our eyes may teach us, that it is of wonderful greatneſs, although we cannot ſee how large it is; if we conſider that the Earth is of a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful compaſs, and yet that it is but as a ſpot, or little Ball hanging in the midſt of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and encompaſſed round with thoſe goodly Spheres and Orbs. Yea, even a Child may learn thus much from the light of Reaſon, with a little help, that ſeeing the Sun is big enough to give light to half the Earth at once, and yet ſeemeth ſo little to our eye, it muſt needs be at a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful diſtance from us, perhaps many thouſand miles: Now then, of what wonderful bigneſs is the Heaven it ſelf, being ſo far above the Earth, and yet compaſſing all thoſe huge ſpaces round about the Earth, that are between the Earth and Heaven. Neither may we think, but that this Heaven of Heavens (the Houſe of God) is yet far above the Chamber of the Sun, out of which the Pſalmiſt ſaith, he cometh at his riſing. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider then, Chriſtian Reader, what did ever any man find in the Earth, that ſhould make him ſo willing to ſell Heaven for it? if a man could have it all, it were not comparable to the loweſt Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in Heaven, if any be lower then other. All is vanity (ſaith the Preacher) ſpeaking of all things under the Sun, eſpecially when they be compared with thoſe large, ſpacious, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Manſions above the Sun. Who then can ſufficiently deteſt that folly, which preferreth
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52862:77"/> the leaſt part of the earth, which the Lord tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth under foot as his foot-ſtool, above the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Heaven, the large extent whereof ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roundeth and encompaſſeth the whole World?</p>
                  <p>How ſhould this comfort Chriſtians, that though they be pent up and ſtraitned here, yet in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven they ſhall have room enough, there ſhall be <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> there the Lord will make room for us. Here is comfort againſt thoſe engroſſing oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, which joyn houſe to houſe, and leave no room for the poor; if thou labour to be rich in faith, thou ſhalt find that they cannot ſhoulder thee out from an happy and large poſſeſſion in that heavenly Kingdom: Mayſt thou not take comfort in a ſmoaky Cottage, aſſuring thy ſelf of thy part in a moſt glorious Pallace? what if thou haſt but little of the Earth, or none at all, is it not abundantly ſufficient that thou ſhalt enjoy ſo much of Heaven as thy Soul can deſire? yea, that there ſhall be no encloſures there, but all that glorious Inheritance ſhall lie common to all the Heirs of promiſe. Look not with a longing eye upon a fairer or more convenient Houſe then thine own, upon wider Fields and greater Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions then any that thou art owner of upon Earth; but over-look all theſe, and ſay, to the praiſe of God's grace, with an heart rejoycing in the Lord, yet I have more then all the World is worth.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, none of the Faithful need to fear that he ſhould be ſhut out for want of room in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:52862:77"/> this heavenly Palace; here is many Manſions; here is a place appointed for every true Believer; the pooreſt Chriſtian ſhall not miſs of an happy habitation in this Houſe of our Father. <hi>Lazarus</hi> though he lie full of ſores and rags without doors there on Earth, yet there he ſhall have a ſweet repoſe in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſome.</p>
                  <p>Let this comfort a Believer againſt all ſolitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and want of company in this life; in the Houſe of thy heavenly Father are many Manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and theſe ſhall not ſtand empty for want of Inhabitants: Oh what Troops of glorious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints ſhall live together in thoſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Manſions! how ſhall they flock together from the Eaſt, and from the Weſt, and from the North, and from the South, there ſitting down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in the Kingdom! It is a ſtrange weakneſs to be diſcontented for want of company; but a greater, and worthy of all reproof, to go out of the narrow way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſo ſolitary, and to turn into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon road, becauſe of company. Oh the folly and infidelity of our hearts! can we not with patience ſtay for ſo much good Company as we ſhall find and for ever enjoy in our Father's Houſe?</p>
                  <p>For although the number that ſhall be ſaved, ſhall be but a very ſmall number in compariſon of the numberleſs multitude that are already loſt, and do haſten to deſtruction; although when the Church was greateſt upon Earth, as in the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:52862:78"/> Apoſtles times, the number of the wicked did much exceed it; yet take thoſe many thouſands of holy Angels which keep their firſt eſtate, and joyn to theſe multitudes of holy men and women of all ſorts, that lived before the flood, after the flood, before the law, after the law, before Chriſts coming in the fleſh, after his incarnation, until this day, and from this day that ſhall live to the end of the world, of all Nations under heaven; then who can tell the duſt of <hi>Jacob,</hi> or number the fourth part (the four hundredth part) of this Iſrael of God? the remnant and gleanings of thoſe that have lived in ſo many thouſand years will ariſe to an unſpeakable multitude. After the ſealing of the hundred and forty four thouſand of the twelve Tribes, St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, I beheld, and lo a great multitude, which no man could number, of all Nations, and Kinred, and People, and Tongues, ſtood before the Throne, and before the Lamb, cloathed with white Robes, and Palms in their hands.</p>
                  <p>How ſhould this rejoyce every faithful Soul, reſting in hope of this ſweeteſt and moſt bleſſed Society. Though in the mean time thou ſeeſt many frown upon thee, and ſleight thee to thy face, yea, even ſhun thy company, yet labour thou for an aſſured part in thy Father's Houſe, and then rejoyce in aſſured hope there to find many dwelling places, and in thoſe places many Dwellers, many ſweet Companions. Though a man were conſtrained to live like an Eremite,

Jacob</hi> had ſuch a love to his Father <hi>Iſaac,</hi> though very old and blind, that he ſore longed to be gone from <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> to his Father's houſe; how much more ſhould we labour for ſuch love to our heavenly Father, who is infinite in all excellency and glory, as ſhould make us weary of being here, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly to long after our heavenly Father's Houſe? It was a good change for <hi>Jacob</hi> to go from <hi>Laban,</hi> an unkind Father-in-law, unto <hi>Iſaac</hi> a loving and tender-hearted Father; but what a bleſſed change is it for the Children of God, to go from the World, a cruel Step-mother, yea, a dangerous Enemy, unto God their heavenly and moſt gracious Father! to go from among
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:52862:79"/> Swearers, Worldlings, Drunkards, Prophane Perſons, Scorners of Religion, Perſecutors, to go from Snares and Temptations, to go from Sin, and the danger of Sin, to go from the lower Region, which is (as it were) under the feet of Satan, who is (as it were) over our heads, being the Prince of the power of the Air; I ſay, to go from all theſe, and to go into the arms of the Lord our moſt gracious Father, ſhould not a Child of God long after this exceedingly? It ſheweth want of love in a Child, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious diſpoſition, when he ſecretly longeth for his Father's Lands or Goods, becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enjoy them unleſs his Father die, whoſe life ſhould be much dearer to a Child then all his Goods or Lands; but it argueth the truth of our love to our heavenly Father, when we have an earneſt longing after that glorious Inheritance of his, becauſe we ſhall live with him in the everlaſting Habitations. And to this end let us labour to get our Souls fully aſſured that the Lord is our Father in Jeſus Chriſt, and that we are his Children, that ſo we may long after our Father's Houſe. If we ſaw our Father's Houſe, we would cry to be over the Water, and to be carried in Chriſt's arms out of this borrowed Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The Earth is the Lord's lower Houſe; while we are lodged here, we have no aſſurance to lie ever in one Chamber, but muſt be content ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to remove from one corner of our Lord's nether Houſe to another, reſting in hope, that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:52862:79"/> when we come up to the Lord's upper Houſe, we ſhall remove no more, becauſe then we ſhall be at home. We now ſee and hear at home and abroad nothing but matter of grief and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, which indeed maketh our life bitter; but let this comfort all faithful Chriſtians, that Chriſt is coming to fetch them to his Father's Houſe; his Father will make them welcome, and give them houſe-room; and though they change dwelling places, yet they ſhall not change their Maſter, nor their ſervices: <hi>His Servants ſhall ſerve him,</hi> Revel. 22.3.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>As Rewards of Virtue;</hi> therefore by ancient ſtories it appeareth, that almoſt all Nations, ſuch as excelled in Valour or in Learning, they were Crowned with one thing or another; ſome with Roſes, ſome with Laurel, or Bayes, ſome with Olives, ſome with Gold, that ſo they might cheriſh the profeſſion and exerciſe of Arts and Virtues: to theſe the Scripture alluding, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth Crowns, and a Kingdom, as the goodlieſt rewards we can either deſire or receive, to ſuch as through faith and patience overcome either the affections of their ſinful Nature, or the afflictions of this wretched World. Hence I infer, how abject ſoever the condition of the Saints be upon Earth, it ſhall be moſt glorious in Heaven; glory ſhall follow their ſufferings, as the day followeth the night; there is no glory upon Earth you know greater then the glory of Kings: it is true, Popes of late days have ſtriven to out-climb them; ſo the Bramble in <hi>Jotham</hi>'s Parable would
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:52862:80"/> have out-climbed the Cedar; they would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the World, that they were created as the Sun to rule the Day, that is, over the Clergy; and that Kings are but as the Moon, to rule over the Night, that is (ſay they) over the Laity: But Popes are no Creatures of God's making; Kings are the anointed of the Lord; God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath given teſtimony ſufficient of their mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, in that it hath pleaſed him to change Names with them, and taken their Name to himſelf; he is called a King, and gives them his own Name in exchange, for therefore he hath ſaid, they are Gods.</p>
                  <p>I urge it the rather, becauſe of the inference that followeth; for the greater Kings are, the greater Chriſtians are; for Chriſtians are ſaid to be Kings, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. <hi>He hath made us all Kings and Prieſts unto God.</hi> And to the meaneſt and moſt abject Chriſtian a Crown ſhall be given, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely far more excellent and glorious then the Crowns of all earthly Kings.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the Soveraignty that belongs to it: Crowns are Enſigns of Soveraignty, as I hinted before; and Soveraignty is a thing much accounted of: to be but as the Centurion was, would put a ſpirit of ambition into us, that we might have thoſe under us, to whom when we ſay, <hi>Go, they ſhould go;</hi> when <hi>Come, they ſhould come;</hi> when <hi>Do this, they ſhould do it.</hi> If we could have not only Perſons, but Provinces un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our ſubjection, and could make our ſelves
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52862:81"/> Commanders and Rulers over Countries and Kingdoms, ſo that People ſhould ſerve us, and Nations ſhould bow before us, this would kindle a great fire of ambition in us; it would make one that had the aſpiring mind of <hi>Abſalom</hi> to ſnatch the Crown from his Father's head. If we could climb higher yet, and get to be not only Soveraigns over divers Provinces, as <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> was, but alſo be Monarchs of the whole World, as it is ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> was, ſo that the Princes of all Nations ſhould pay Tribute to our Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,<note place="margin">Si jus violandum, regni cauſa violan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum. <hi>Caeſar</hi> ex <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripide.</hi>
                     </note> and the People of all Countries bow their knees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our foot-ſtool; this (if any thing) would enflame our ambition; and if at all, for a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom one would violate the bonds of Nature, or Juſtice (as one long ago was wont to ſay) for ſuch a Kingdom as this, he would be provoked to the doing of it.</p>
                  <p>Alas, Beloved, all this is nothing in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the Soveraignty belonging to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Crown and Kingdom; the pooreſt Saint in Heaven ſhall be more glorious in Soveraignty then ever <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> or <hi>Alexander</hi> were, or then ever <hi>Adam</hi> was when he was Lord of the whole World; for look what was ſaid of our Saviour, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.8. <hi>All things ſhall be ſubdued, all things ſhall be brought in ſubjection to him; and when it is ſaid, all things ſhall be ſubdued, there's nothing left out that ſhall not be ſubdued:</hi> the ſame may
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52862:81"/> be ſaid of every faithful Member of Chriſt, they ſhall every one have a ſhare in this Rule and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion; even all things ſhall be brought under their ſubjection; the very Angels ſhall then be made ſubject to them: where Chriſt ſits, they ſhall ſit; whom Chriſt judgeth, they ſhall judg; and as Chriſt reigneth, they ſhall reign alſo.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In reſpect of the ſafety that belongs to it: there is no Crown ſo ſetled upon the head of any earthly Prince, as that he can promiſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf perpetual ſafety under it; either ſafety from ſickneſs and diſeaſes, or ſafety from Adverſaries and Enemies, either domeſtical or forreign, but that he is in danger of both. Kings are as much in danger of ſickneſs as other men; for Chairs of State are not Caſtles of health, nor can their Crowns keep their heads from aking; they are as much in danger of Enemies as other men, nay they more then others: every railing <hi>Shimei</hi> hath a tongue to bark at them; every traiterous <hi>Sheba</hi> will be blowing trumpets of rebellion againſt them; but the Crown of glory ſhall ſit ſure upon the heads of the faithful, even with as much ſafety as majeſty; no ſickneſs ſhall be able to blaſt it, no Enemy to endanger it. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>all our Enemies ſhall be put under our feet,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.27. And the Prophet ſaith, <hi>All tears ſhall be wiped from our faces,</hi> Iſai. 25.8.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In reſpect of the peace and tranquility of it: the Princes of the Earth, though they have a great many more honours, yet they have a great
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52862:82"/> many more burthens then other men; their Crowns are thicker ſtuck with cares then with gems: That made one of the Emperours ſay, when the Imperial Robe was brought him to put on, <hi>Oh nobilem magis quam faelicem pannum:</hi> Oh here's a Robe, ſaith he, fuller of bravery then felicity. 'Tis otherwiſe with the Crown of glory, this Crown is as free from troubles as from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; they that are crowned with it, are crowned with peace as well as with honour; it ſhall not diſquiet them with cares, but give them reſt from their labours; reſt and peace ſhall ever wait upon them, whom God ſhall vouchſafe ſo to dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, as to let their Temples be empall'd with this glorious Crown.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In reſpect of perpetuity: therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle calls it <hi>a Crown of Life,</hi> James 1.12. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they that are crowned with it ſhall never taſte more of death. Herein again it differs from all earthly Crowns, and excells as much as it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers; earthly Kingdoms and Crowns are ſubject to alteration, to diſſipation: <hi>Job</hi> tells us, that God ſometimes <hi>looſeth the collars of Kings,</hi> Job 12.13. It was told <hi>Saul,</hi> when he had been a while King over Iſrael, that God had rent his Kingdom from him, and given it to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.28. But howſoever, though the Crown be not tranſlated, yet he that wears the Crown muſt be tranſlated; Death will tranſlate the greateſt Princes to another place, though while they live their Crowns be not tranſlated
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:52862:82"/> to other Perſons, but ſit faſt upon their own heads; but 'tis otherwiſe with this Crown of life, there ſhall be no alteration nor removal at all, either from it to us, or from us to it, when once we ſhall have it confer'd upon us: Were the Kingdoms of the Earth never ſo full of glory and happineſs, yet what they want of perpetuity, they want of perfect felicity; there can be no perfection of bleſſedneſs, but where there is perpetuity of continuance: ſo there ſhall be here: St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it <hi>an immarceſſible Crown.</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls it <hi>an immortal inheritance that ſhall never fade away,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.4. It is ſaid of the Bread of life, <hi>John</hi> 6. that <hi>he that eats of it, ſhall hunger no more;</hi> and of the Water of life, <hi>John</hi> 4. he that <hi>drinketh thereof, ſhall thirst no more:</hi> ſo I may ſay of this Crown of life, whoſoever is crowned with it, he <hi>ſhall die no more.</hi> How ſhould the conſideration hereof make us to labour for this glorious Crown? what a ſhame is it to ſee what pains men will take for a little honour, that cometh ſhort of a Kingdom? what pains to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their luſts, and to get a little of the World, and that we ſhould take ſo little pains for the Kingdom of Heaven? <hi>So run,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that you may obtain; not a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.24, 25.</note> 
                     <hi>but an incorruptible Crown: Thoſe that run for a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Crown, they are temperate in all things;</hi> they eat and drink very little, they diet their bodies; they neither cumber their bodies with
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:52862:83"/> ſuperfluous garments, nor their ſtomacks with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous meats and drinks, becauſe theſe things would hinder them in their contention, and make them loſe the Crown and Garland they run for. Now if there be ſo much ſtriving for a fading Crown, how ſhould Chriſtians deny themſelves, ſtriving for that Crown of glory which is in Heaven? a Crown not made of Ivory and Lawrel, but made out of the Tree of Life, ſuch as is not of a withering and fading nature: Here is not <hi>jus violandum,</hi> but only <hi>jugum toleran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum;</hi> no law of obedience that we are to break, but a yoke of patience that we muſt learn to bear, to make us capable of this Crown.</p>
                  <p>How ſhould this alſo ſtir up every Chriſtian to walk worthy of God, who hath called him to his Kingdom and glory? 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.11, 12. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it is a Kingdom we look after, let us labour to have kingly affections; it is an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdom, let us learn to lead heavenly converſations. When one urged <hi>Alexander</hi> to run at the Olympian games, he anſwered, <hi>Do Kings run there?</hi> So when the Devil, or the World, do tempt us to ſin, let us anſwer, Do the Heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven do ſo? The Egyptians had a pretty Hieroglyphick,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Plerij</hi> Hieroglyph.</note> by which they deſcribed a great man that was unworthily given, they deſcribed him by an Elephant hunting for Flies; you may imagine what an unſeemly ſight that would be, for ſo
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:52862:83"/> huge a creature as an Elephant, to hunt ſo poor a prey as a Flie. Nothing is ſo unſeemly, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, as for one that profeſſeth Chriſtianity to be vainly or vitiouſly given; to be an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm, a wanton, a belly-god, this is neither Chriſtianly, nor becoming ſpiritual Kings: ſhew your ſelves more heavenly diſpoſed, if you look for an heavenly Kingdom; heavenly thoughts, heavenly deſires, heavenly ſpeeches, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly actions do beſt become thoſe that look for heavenly Crowns. Finally, let the thoughts of your high dignity comfort you, O Chriſtians, under all your ſorrows: So the Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſaid to <hi>Galba</hi> in his minority, taking him up by the chin, <hi>Tu</hi> Galba <hi>quandoque imperium deguſtabis:</hi> Thou, O <hi>Galba,</hi> ſhalt one day be an Emperour, therefore be not ſad. So I may ſay to thee, Chear up, O diſconſolate Chriſtian, thou ſhalt one day be a King, and wear a Crown of glory; think often of your Crown and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and drive away the ſadneſs of your hearts, for ere long ye ſhall be raiſed from a dung-hill of miſeries to an heavenly Kingdom; and the greater your ſufferings are, ſo much the more bright and glorious will your Crown be.</p>

                  <p>FUrthermore, Heaven is the place where the Saints <hi>inheritance</hi> lieth; they are now Heirs of a Kingdom, but not Inheritors; but there is
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:52862:84"/> a time when they ſhall enjoy that inheritance. The Scripture ſets forth what manner of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance Heaven ſhall be to the Saints.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a rich and glorious inheritance; ſome inheritances on Earth are ſo charged and clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that though the inheritance be rich, yet the Heir is poor, and can hardly get a living out of it, becauſe though he receive much, yet he payes much out of it again; but here is no charge nor burthen in any kind, but this inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance that is above is abſolutely free, a rich and glorious inheritance. He that is an Heir of Heaven, never needs to trouble himſelf to grow rich in this World, if his Anceſtors have left him no poſſeſſions, ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine;</hi> the man that loveth earthly riches, hath but little mind to the true riches, to the heavenly inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and he that is beſotted with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of this preſent World, never dreameth of the everlaſting pleaſures of the World to come: but he that hath God for his portion, may ſay with <hi>David, The lines are fallen to me in pleaſant places; yea, I have a goodly inheritage,</hi> Pſal. 16.6. God comprehends all imaginable perfections; nothing is diſperſed in the creature, which is not recollected in the Creator; in Heaven we ſhall enjoy all things in God; and nothing can be wanting to him that enjoyeth all things; for in him is a conſervation of all things that are truly and ſolidly good: in Heaven God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhall be our rich and glorious inheritance;
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52862:84"/> and one of the chiefeſt advantages we ſhall reap in glory, is, that God will be to us inſtead of all things; and that finding in him the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all our deſires, we ſhall there meet with our perfect happineſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is an inheritance of inconceivable excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency: our inheritance is ſo excellent, that we cannot ſo much as form an Idea of it, we want words to expreſs its excellencies; and indeed this might impoſe ſilence upon us, if the liberty we have to ſpeak of God (though incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible) did not permit us to ſpeak and write of this glorious inheritance, the bleſſedneſs whereof is unconceivable: and as when treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God's perfections, when we follow the light of the holy Scriptures, we cannot fail; ſo if we ſail by the ſame Star, we cannot wander in this vaſt Ocean of glory; and this is ſure, we need not fear ſhipwrack on a Sea, where all that are drowned may boaſt themſelves happy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is an incorruptible inheritance, <hi>an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance that never fadeth away,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the beauty and glory of it; it is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor taken from flowers; the graſs withereth, the flower fadeth, but this inheritance <hi>never fadeth.</hi> All creatures that were made for the uſe of man, were ſubject to vanity for the ſin of man; but this Heaven at the firſt was not made for the uſe of man, but for God himſelf, therefore it is <hi>incorruptible.</hi> What a ſhame is it that we can ride and run for a leaſe of two or
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:52862:85"/> three years, but the inheritance that fades not away is not eſteemed by us? and as this inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance is incorruptible, ſo likewiſe it is <hi>unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed,</hi> in regard it is not ſubject to any abuſe of the creatures; no unclean thing enters into it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is an <hi>immortal</hi> inheritance: though a Chriſtian's life be ſubject to change, and his days upon earth muſt have an end, yet his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance abideth for ever; yea, God himſelf is the everlaſting inheritance of his people, who fills their deſires, perfecteth all the powers of their ſouls, and communicateth himſelf ſo freely and ſo fully to his Children, that they are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſatisfied: God is the inheritance of his People to eternity, and it is no preſumption to ſtyle him ſo,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Auguſt.</hi> in Pſal. 32.</note> ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> though he be our Creator, and our Sovereign, becauſe it is the fervency of our deſire, and the ſweetneſs of our hope, that puts this name into our mouthes.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is a ſure and ſafe inheritance; <hi>it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in Heaven for us,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. A Chriſtian's tenure is the faireſt, firmeſt, and ſureſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis great wiſdom to lay hold on this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly inheritance, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12. We know it is worldly wiſdom to lay up our treaſures in ſafe places; and ſhall not we be ſo wiſe in ſpiritual matters, where our treaſure far ſurpaſſeth all earthly things?</p>
                  <p>Now here let us ſee the differences between
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:52862:85"/> temporal inheritances, and the heavenly inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Some earthly Parents are very poor, and can leave their children no inheritance to make them Heirs, only they inherit their corruptions, and puniſhments due to them; but all God's Children are rich Heirs, they are all fellow Citizens of the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> of the Houſhold of God, inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.19. they are all made meet partakers of the inheritance among the Saints in light, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.12. Chriſt is the great Heir of all things; and all the Saints, be they never ſo poor outwardly, yet are they Co-heirs with Chriſt, Heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>James</hi> 2.5.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Fathers that have inheritances, do often leave them but to one of their Children; as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> left the inheritance to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and gave gifts only to the Sons of the Concubines, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.5, 6. but here all God's Children have the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly inheritance. Upon Earth, if all do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Father's ſubſtance, then it is divided, and every one hath the leſs; but Heaven is not divided by lot, as <hi>Canaan</hi> was, which was a type of it; there the inheritance of the one doth not diminiſh the inheritance of the other; their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance is ſo large, that the number of Heirs cannot diminiſh it; the good that they hope for, hath two properties that ſecure it from envy; it is one, and cannot be divided; it is infinite, and ſufficeth many thouſands: it's unity is the cauſe
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:52862:86"/> that every one poſſeſſeth it entire; it's infinity, that none are affraid of a leſſening; they are all rich of the ſame inheritance, they are all happy by the ſame felicity: For, as <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, <hi>That heavenly inheritance unto all is one, and unto one is all; for as much as every one of the bleſſed Saints rejoyceth as much at the joys and felicities of all others, as if he were in poſſeſſion of the ſame.</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven becometh all to all, and all to every one; as all enjoy the light of the Sun when it ſhineth; every one in Heaven is well pleaſed with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers happineſs, and with his own; and the charity that reigneth among the Saints there, doth ſo intimately unite their hearts, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of particulars diſturbeth not the bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the whole.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. On Earth Parents leave their inheritances to their Children, becauſe they die, and can keep them no longer; but God liveth for ever, and beſtoweth the inheritance upon us: in the World Parents die before their Children may inherit; but God is immortal, and Death never ſeperates the Children from the Father; he hath Heirs, but no Succeſſors; he deſpoils not himſelf to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich them, but living and reigning with them, he confers his inheritance upon them without looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. In this World all Sons and Heirs do not live to take poſſeſſion of their inheritance; but all God's Heirs ſhall be infallibly poſſeſſed of their heavenly inheritance; the poſſeſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:52862:86"/> ſhall be given them by Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, the Heir of all things; he ſhall come from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to conduct them to Heaven, and put them into the poſſeſſion of their inheritance in the view of the whole World; and it ſhall be given to them in their beſt ſtate, when they are moſt fitted and qualified to that condition which is ſuitable to their ſtate; for in the ſtate that now we are, we are not in a capacity to be put into poſſeſſion of that heavenly inheritance.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Some Heirs, if they live to be of age, yet they are often kept from their inheritance, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded of it, or unjuſtly turn'd out of it, that either they come not into actual poſſeſſion, or cannot long keep it; but none ſhall keep God's Children out of their inheritance, or defraud them of it.</p>
                  <p>Now this inheritance cometh to us by the right of Sonſhip only; <hi>If Sons, then Heirs,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 8.17. Only the Children of God are Heirs of Heaven: the Wicked have no por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this inheritance, it is for Sons; the Son of <hi>Hagar</hi> muſt have no inheritance with the Son of <hi>Sarah; the Bond-woman and her Son must be cast out.</hi> The Wicked are like Slaves, who labour not but for their Maſter; they till the Ground, but reap not the Fruit; they plant Vine-yards, but drink not of the Wine; they ſuffer much pain and another taſtes the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: they are not as Wives, called into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of goods; they are not as Children, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52862:87"/> to ſhare in the inheritance; but the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God find riches in their pooreſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eſtate; their Maſter adopting them for his Children, makes them his Heirs; and before he gives them his glory for their portion, he gives them the earneſt of the Spirit for their aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of this inheritance.</p>
                  <p>Then caſt away all carking cares, O Chriſtian, ſince thy inheritance is in Heaven; and be not diſquieted, though haply God deal no better with thee for the preſent then with a Servant, for that is a diſcipline fit to prepare thee for thine inheritance: God may bring ſome great and ſharp affliction upon thee, he may beat thee, buffet thee, ſcourge thee, yet thou canſt not looſe thine inheritance, for it is entailed, and God hath made it ſure to thee by his promiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.8. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13, 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17. Oh do not grudge at the happineſs of the wicked; do they proſper? have they all things at will? thou art not inferiour to them, for thou alſo haſt an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance reſerved for thee; and this inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is not bought by thee, but fitted and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for thee; and thou ſhalt have no ruinous Cottage, but that which is fit for thy purpoſe when thou comeſt to Heaven; and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever loſſes thou meeteſt with in this World, loſs of Wife, Children, Goods, Friends, Life, yet thou canſt not loſe thine Inheritance: This cauſed the <hi>Hebrews</hi> with joy to endure the ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their goods, <hi>knowing that in Heaven they
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:52862:87"/> had a more enduring ſubſtance,</hi> Hebr. 10.34.</p>
                  <p>Let us all therefore labour to become the Sons of God; and that we may be ſo, let us labour for faith to believe in Chriſt, and labour after all the graces of God's Spirit, hereby we ſhall be made <hi>meet partakers of the inheritance among the Saints in light,</hi> Col. 1.12. The inheritance is given <hi>to the ſanctified,</hi> Acts 26.18. to ſuch as are in Chriſt, and of Chriſt, by faith unfeigned, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. Let us all labour to make God our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance; as God hath right and title to us, ſo let us labour by faith to challenge the ſame in him; and not be like a fooliſh child, who would buy his father's inheritance, when he was born to it, and it is his right: Like the Papiſts, who think by their own merits to purchaſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Kingdom of Heaven, to which (were they God's Children, and belonged to him) they would be Heirs apparent. Reader, clear up thy right to this inheritance, &amp; keep thy indentures ſafe, and let Satan come with the offer of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to thee, as he did to Chriſt, then wilt thou not, with prophane <hi>Eſau,</hi> ſell thine inheritance: Oh take heed of that prophane ſpeech of his, in ſaying, <hi>What is this Birth-right to me?</hi> Gen. 25.32. but ſay with <hi>Naboth, God forbid that I ſhould ſell the Inheritance of my Fathers unto thee,</hi> 1 Reg. 21.3. St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaking to his Auditors, uttered theſe notable words; Let us be grieved to ſee men diſtracted with the diverſity of their deſires; let us ſee their different conditions, which ariſe
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:52862:88"/> from the difference of their deſigns; let ſome take Arms, and ſeek for glory in the mouth of danger; hazard their lives to get themſelves a name, and place their happineſs in killing and ſlaying; let others more harmleſs, but leſs am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, plead at the Bar, gain reputation in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending innocence, and aſpire to the glory of Orators, being not able to purchaſe that of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors; let others more humble, but not leſs intereſſed, hold commerce and traffick with Strangers, paſs the Seas to content their avarice, deſcend into the bowels of the Earth to dig out treaſures; let others more innocent, but not leſs miſerable, till the ground, maſter barrenneſs by their laborious improvement, and at the years end reap a rich and plentiful Harveſt; let all theſe different conditions divide the heap of periſhable goods between them, but let Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, inſtructed in a better School, proteſt that God and Heaven are their portion, and that now and for ever they will have no other inheritance. Finally, this conſideration, that Heaven is a Chriſtian's inheritance, may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thee againſt the death of thy godly Friend: Though thy Friend be gone to another City, yet grieve not over-much, he is gone but to his Lordſhip, to his own inheritance; and let all true Believers reſolve to let the movables go, ſince the inheritance is theirs.</p>

                  <p>IN the next place, I ſhall ſhew you that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is that bleſſed place where the Saints ſhall receive their great and glorious reward. The Scripture tells us, that <hi>Verily there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for the righteous,</hi> Pſal. 58.11. and this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhall be <hi>a great reward;</hi> and the place where they ſhall receive this reward <hi>is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> Matth. 5.12. There is a two-fold reward:
<q>
                        <l>Praemium Vincentium;</l>
                        <l>Merces Laborantium.</l>
                     </q>
                     <q>
                        <l>The Reward of Conquerors;</l>
                        <l>The Wages of Labourers.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Reward of Conquerors: <hi>Bleſſed is the man that endureth tribulation; for when he is tried, he ſhall receive the Crown of life,</hi> James 1.12. A Crown is the honour of thoſe that ſtrive, of thoſe that were put into the Liſts; and St. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith well, <hi>The Crown is the reward of Victory.</hi> True it is, all the Saints have the promiſe of a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Crown and reward, but they have a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial promiſe thereunto that endure tribulation, becauſe they are brought to the ſtrife of faith,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:52862:89"/> and have <hi>fought the good fight,</hi> and <hi>kept the faith,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf, and upon this he challengeth his reward, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. It pleaſeth God many times to ſhew his great power and mercy in the ſtrengthning of thoſe that ſuffer for the truth, when they come to ſeal the profeſſion of it with their blood, with invincible courage he enableth them to endure the pains of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom, even to the admiration of the beholders, and many times to the aſtoniſhment of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors themſelves; they go to be martyred, as if they were going to be married; they embrace the Croſs, they kiſs the Stake, they ſing Pſalms to God in the midſt of the Fire; they are filled with ſuch Divine raptures, as you would rather think them in their Transfiguration, then at their Execution; this is <hi>praemium ante praemium,</hi> a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward beforehand: But that which heightens their courage, and makes them to glory in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, is the conſideration of that great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that is laid up for them in Heaven: this is like the opening of the Heavens to <hi>Stephen,</hi> that encouraged him to reſiſt unto the loſs of his blood.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is the reward of Labourers, the wages of them that work and labour in the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; the Labourer laboureth all the day, but at night he receiveth <hi>his penny,</hi> Matth. 20. The Labourers in the Vineyard were called in at night, and received every one his penny, that is, his proper reward; the Lord would have his
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:52862:89"/> work well done, and he will ſpare for no coſt; the diligent ſhall not loſe their labour; the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God requireth it, that he ſhould pay his Servants their wages when they have done their work; <hi>their labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But it may be ſaid, if eternal life be a reward, or wages, then the labours of his Children are meritorious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. By way of relation to merit: there is wages of grace, not of merit; though the Greek and Latine words <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and <hi>merces,</hi> rather ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie hire, or wages, then gift, or reward: Yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us to diſtinguiſh, that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, wages, may be reckoned to a man by favour, not by debt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. This appeareth in them who being called into the Vineyard at the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth hour, yet received a penny for wages by favour, not by debt, as much as they who were firſt called, and had born the burden and heat of the day.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is wages in regard of the promiſe of God, for he hath promiſed to give eternal life to them that believe and obey him; the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance whereof they may lawfully expect, though they cannot deſerve it: Promiſe is a debt, and God hath made himſelf a Debtor to his People by promiſe. If a Subject, or Servant to a King, doth him any remarkable ſervice, it is but his duty; yet ſuch is the uſual bounty of Princes, as they will abundantly reward it, as is manifeſt <hi>Eſther</hi> 6.3.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:52862:90"/>3. It is called wages, becauſe God recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſeth the obedience of his Children of free mercy through the obedience of Chriſt; it is not ſuch a wages as a Maſter gives his Servant for his labour, but as a Father gives his Child; of love, not of merit. Therefore ſaith St. <hi>Paul, Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not to men; knowing that of the Lord ye ſhall receive the reward of the inheritance,</hi> Coloſ. 3.23, 24. <hi>for ye ſerve the Lord Christ,</hi> Epheſ. 2.9. <hi>We are ſaved by grace, not of works, lest any man ſhould boast.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is called wages, not in regard of merit, but in regard of order; becauſe as wages is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally given at the end of the labour, ſo this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is given at the end of our days. <hi>Be thou faithful to the death, and I will give thee the Crown of life,</hi> Rev. 2.10.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In regard of faith, that looks at ſalvation as the end and wages of all her labours. St. <hi>Peter</hi> writing to thoſe of the diſperſion, ſpeaks of their receiving <hi>the end of their faith, the ſalvation of their ſouls,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.9.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But it may be ſaid, this reward is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional,</hi> Rom. 8.17. <hi>that if we ſuffer with Christ, we ſhall reign with him; where merits ſeem not to be excluded.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer, the condition notes out there the order, not the cauſe of reigning; which may ſerve to comfort us in afflictions, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.7, 8.</p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:52862:90"/>
                  <p>Now I ſhall make it evident, that this reward is a reward of mercy, not out of merit. For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In a merit there muſt be <hi>relatio muneris &amp; remunerati;</hi> a relation between our giving to God, and his giving to us; and it is not poſſible for the infinite God to receive any thing from us: we can give nothing to him, but what at firſt came from him, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.11, 14. <hi>Who hath first given to God, and it ſhall be recompenſed to him again?</hi> Rom. 11.35.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The obedience performed muſt be <hi>materia indebita,</hi> to make it meritorious; but we are every way bound to God; we are bound by the bond of Creation to be ſerviceable to him: By Nature we owe him our ſervice, from whom we receive our being. We are alſo bound by the bond of Redemption; we are none of our own, but his that hath ranſomed us, and therefore wholly uncapable of meriting any thing at the hands of God. Every meritorious work muſt be free, proceeding from our own meer good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, it muſt not be a duty which we are bound to do: now all that we do or ſuffer, is but duty commanded by God, and we ſtand bound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der many obligations to do them; works of duty cannot merit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Every meritorious work, muſt be a man's own proper work: now the good we do, is not of our ſelves, but of God that gives us the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of performing it; it is by the grace of God we are enabled to do and ſuffer. <hi>To you it is given
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:52862:91"/> to believe, and to ſuffer for Christ,</hi> Phil. 1.29. <hi>It is God that worketh in us both to will and to do,</hi> Phil. 2.13. <hi>It is God that worketh all our works in us, and for us,</hi> Iſai. 26.12. We are infinitely indebted to God for enabling us to do any thing for God; and the giving of one gift, is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation that therefore one ſhould give another <hi>ex condigno.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. In a merit, the work done muſt bear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion with the reward; now what is the giving of a mite, or penny, to the purchaſe of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? what proportion is there between an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite reward, and a finite work? an eternal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and a temporary work? ſuch is our work, ſuch is God's reward. So Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.10. <hi>When you have done all thoſe things which are commanded you, ſay, We are unprofitable ſervants, we have done that which was our duty to do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. There is ſo much defect in our beſt works, that it is impoſſible they ſhould merit any thing out of juſtice; for who can think they ſhould deſerve puniſhment out of juſtice, and merit a reward out of juſtice too? That work which meriteth muſt be perfectly perfect, there muſt be no flaw, not a ſhadow of privative imperfection in it; if God ſhould be extream to mark what we have done amiſs, Hell would be the reward <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:52862:91"/> Chriſt ſaith of his Sheep, <hi>I give unto them eternal life,</hi> John 10.28.

                     </note> it is only a gift; compare eternal life to the work, and look no further, ſo the Scripture calls it a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; but conſider the original from whence the work it ſelf alſo proceedeth, and all is meerly and wholly gift, ſaith learned Biſhop <hi>Abbot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Hereby the merits of Chriſt would be made of no validity; Chriſt hath merited for us to the uttermoſt, and nothing can be contributed by us, becauſe he hath done it alone: ſo then eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life follows upon an holy life; not as remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated from any merit of ours, but as conferr'd in much mercy by God for the merits of Chriſt.

I ſhall wave this, and ſhew you
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:52862:92"/> how the reward in Heaven is called a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. It is great abſolutely in it ſelf conſidered; the great God himſelf is the reward of his Saints, the Kingdom of Heaven is their reward; we ſhould count an earthly Kingdom a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, much more all the Kingdoms in the World, that is a vaſt reward indeed; but what is all the World, and the Kingdoms thereof, in compariſon of Heaven? 'tis but as a drop of a Bucket com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the Sea, the duſt in the Ballance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the Earth, and a ſpark of Fire compared to the Sun; there is ſome compariſon in theſe, for both are finite; but there is no proportion between God and the whole World; perfection of holineſs, perfection of glory, perfection of joy, perfection of pleaſure is this great reward.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Conſider the properties of this reward, and you will ſee it is a great reward.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is an infinite reward, far above the ſight of the eye, it cannot comprehenſively behold it; the ear cannot hear the greatneſs of it; the heart cannot conceive it: Were the Sea ink, and the Heavens parchment, and all Angels and Men ſet on work to delineate the greatneſs of it, they could not deſcribe it; the reward is great, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as God is, and who knoweth how great he is?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is an all-ſufficient, and all-ſatisfying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: why doth the holy Ghoſt call it after ſo many names, ſometimes calling it the Kingdom
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:52862:92"/> of Heaven, the ſight of God, a Crown, a Crown of life, joy, Rivers of pleaſures, ſometimes a Supper, the Marriage of the Lamb, white Robes, Paradiſe? the reaſon is, becauſe it is ſo great, that one expreſſion is not enough to deſcribe it; it is an all-ſufficient, and an all-ſatisfying reward. When the great day of recompence ſhall come, wherein God will beſtow his reward upon his Saints, all Heaven ſhall cry out, Lord, I have enough, I need no more, I deſire no more: this reward is common to millions of glorified Saints, and all are ſatisfied with it. Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is a moſt ſatisfying object; the beauty of his face, the ſmell of his garments, the Sea and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Salvation, that capacious and wide Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where God, his Angels and Saints are, are intrinſecally, and of themſelves moſt raviſhing, and ſoul-ſatisfying objects; there the Soul drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and drinketh abundantly, and is fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, ſo that the veſſel can hold no more; there the Soul is always quietly repoſing it ſelf in the arms and embraces of the glorious Prince <hi>Immanuel,</hi> always ſucking the breaſts of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conſolations, and delighting it ſelf with the abundance of glory.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is called a great reward <hi>comparate,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the active and paſſive obedience of Saints in this World: For as learned <hi>Spanhemius</hi> obſerveth on <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.11.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Spanhem.</hi> dub. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangel.</note> our Saviour doth not make compariſon between reward, and

                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Here it may be demanded, <hi>Whether we may have an eye to the reward in our obedience?</hi> The Papiſts cry out upon us, as if we did deny that the godly ought to have reſpect unto the promiſed reward to quicken them to duty: And it is true, that ſome miſtaking Divines have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to this opinion, that in no caſe a godly man is to eye the glory promiſed to quicken him to duty; becauſe, ſay they, in ſo doing we ſhew forth mercenary, not filial duty; and we do not do and ſuffer for God's ſake, but for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> There is no doubt but we may have an eye to the glorious reward, elſe why doth our Saviour here, and in other places, propoſe the reward to us, and promiſe a reward? And it is ſaid of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that <hi>he had an eye to the recompence of the reward,</hi> Heb. 11.26. Yea, it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. that <hi>for the glory ſet before him, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame.</hi> Although
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:52862:93"/> we may not chiefly aim at our own profit, but the performance of God's pleaſure; yet ſurely we may be moved to the doing our duties for hope of reward, as alſo reſtrained from ſin, though not principally, yet partly for fear of puniſhment; elſe why would God uſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and promiſes in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture? ſaith <hi>Peter Martyr.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pet. Mart.</hi> loc. com.</note> Here let us obſerve theſe Rules.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The glory of God muſt be the primary mark at which we muſt chiefly aim; as he made all things primarily for his glory, ſo muſt we do all to the ſame end: did our lives ſtand in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with God's glory, we ought to chuſe rather to ſeek the advancing of God's glory, then to ſeek to preſerve our lives; nay, if our very ſalvation ſtood in competition with the glory of God, we ought to chuſe rather the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of God's glory, then to ſeek for our own ſalvation: yet God's mercy is ſo great to us, that his glory and our ſalvation are ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted together, that we cannot ſeek the one, but we ſhall infallibly obtain the other.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our own duty muſt next to the glory of God, have the uppermoſt room in our hearts; the duty which we owe to God in doing and ſuffering, muſt be reſpected before the reward which God will give us; his holy commands muſt be a ſtronger incitement to duty, then his gifts.

We muſt not eye the reward, <hi>qua merces,</hi> as it is a reward due, but as 'tis a gift of free grace; not as it is a remunerating act of God's juſtice, but as a crowning act and fruit of free mercy. Then ſee the pride of Papiſts, who ſay, it were not for their honour to have eternal life <hi>gratis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. We may look on the reward as God's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and as an encouragement he propoſeth to us, to move us the more ſwiftly to run the race that is ſet before us. Every one propoundeth this to himſelf in any undertaking, <hi>Quid habebo?</hi> What ſhall I have if I do or ſuffer? And St. <hi>Peter</hi> proveth the queſtion, <hi>Lord, we have left all and followed thee, and what ſhall we receive?</hi> It was a cuſtom among great Princes, when they ſet upon any notable work, they would encourage the undertakers to come to the work by the propounding of wages, prizes, and rewards:
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:52862:94"/> but we muſt have an eye to the reward, <hi>non tam ut utile nobis, quam ut bonum in ſe;</hi> not ſo much as it is profitable to us, and looking to our own advantage, as to the goodneſs of the reward it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We may look on the recompence of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as an incitation to patience under ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; we need encouragement to move us to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience under all thoſe miſeries and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that attend our following Chriſt: Hence it was that Chriſt, to allay the ſharpneſs of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, propounds the greatneſs of the reward; this cauſed <hi>Moſes</hi> to chuſe rather to ſuffer affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions with God's people, then to enjoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin, which are but for a ſeaſon; eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reproaches of Chriſt greater riches, then all the treaſures of <hi>Egypt;</hi> for, or becauſe he had an eye to the recompence of the reward, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25, 26. Now how ſhould the conſideration of this great reward in Heaven, which a Chriſtian ſhall receive for his poor labours and ſufferings in this World, make him willing to die, that he may receive his reward: for as a weary Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, having even almoſt tired himſelf with heavy labour, or hard journying, is willing to go to receive his wages of his Maſter, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to betake himſelf to his reſt; ſo ſhould a good Chriſtian, that hath fought a good fight, kept the faith, and almoſt finiſhed his courſe, be willing to die, to go to receive his reward.

When the prodigal Son was but coming towards his Father, when he was yet afar off, his Father ran toward him, and fell upon his neck and kiſſed him; now this is but a ſhadow of that full and glorious reception of the Saints to himſelf, when God ſhall make them all glorious, and receive them without ſpot or wrinkle: if this Prodigal returning from his Harlots, and coming in his rags, was thus acceptable and welcome to his Father, Oh what abundance of love will God then expreſs to his Saints at the laſt day, when they ſhall be all cloathed in long white robes, and be received into the perfection of glory! Mark what is ſaid to the faithful Servant, <hi>Well done thou good and faithful Servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee Ruler over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord,</hi> Matth. 25.23. Then will the Lord Jeſus moſt affectionately ſay to all his Servants, Enter my dear Friends, and receive your conſolation; enter Servants, and receive your wages; enter my Children, and take poſſeſſion of your patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and inheritance; enter my Brethren, and receive your portion: and all ye that have fought the good fight, and kept the faith, and offered violence to the Kingdom of Heaven, enter ye, and take your Crowns.

                     </gap>, come into the joy of thy Lord, take part and poſſeſſion of it with abundance of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and ſatisfaction. The ſoul of man in this World is capable of more pleaſure then the eye or ear, yea then all the ſenſes can bring in to her; our ſoul can drink up all the pleaſures at one draught, it can preſently ſwallow them up; but the joys of Heaven do exceed the deſires of our ſouls; therefore ſaith Chriſt, Enter thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy Maſter's joy; he doth not ſay, let the joy of thy Maſter enter into thee: it is to ſhew, that the joy of our glorious condition doth infinitely ſurpaſs the largeſt capacity of our ſouls, though they be ſtretched to the uttermoſt. So at the laſt day Chriſt will ſay to the Sheep on his right hand, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, receive the Kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the World,</hi> Matth. 25.34. The firſt word is <hi>Venite,</hi> Come; it is the voice of the Bridegroom that ſaith, <hi>Come;</hi> Come to me my Spouſe; that where the Huſband is, there the Bride, the Lamb's Wife may be; that where the Head is, there the Members may be; where the Father is, there the Children may be; where the Maſter is, there the Servants may be; where the Prince and Captain of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, there his Fellow-Souldiers may be. When Chriſt was going out of the World, he chears up the hearts of his Diſciples with theſe conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory words; <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled; in
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:52862:96"/> my Father's Houſe are many Manſions, I go to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a place for you; and if I go, I will come again, and receive you to my ſelf, that where I am, there you may be alſo,</hi> John 14.1, 2. See how much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection Chriſt expreſſeth in theſe words; if Chriſt ſaid when he was upon Earth, Come to me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will eaſe you; take my yoke upon you, and you ſhall find reſt to your ſouls, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28, 29. then much more will he retain the ſame ſweetneſs of affection, when he cometh to ſit down in his Judgment-ſeat. Chriſt is as it were a Servant among his People; <hi>Luke</hi> 22.27. <hi>I am among you as he that ſerveth.</hi> He condeſcendeth to ſerve his People; he went to Heaven in Perſon to prepare a place for them, and he will come again in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to receive them thither: True it is, he will do it with a glorious Train of Angels, yet he will come himſelf, and take them home to his Father's Houſe, that where he is, they may be alſo; and then will he receive them with much affection. Come my Love, my Dove, my Spouſe, my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, where haſt thou been ſo long all this while out of my preſence; come ye into my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, which is now wide open ready to receive you. If <hi>Jacob</hi>'s and <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s meeting were ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſibly comfortable, when they had thought never to have ſeen the faces of each other after ſo long a diſtance, Oh what ſhall the joy of that laſt day be? and how ſhall thoſe noble ſouls re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, yea, leap for joy, to whom theſe ſoul-ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:52862:97"/> words are ſpoken, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father?</hi> all the Muſick in Heaven and Earth will not ſo raviſh them, as this voice will do: Now, though they were the out-caſts of the World, Heaven gates ſhall be ſet wide open for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; the King of glory will bid them come, and welcome; the Spirit and the Bride ſay, come, <hi>&amp;c. Come ye bleſſed of my Father;</hi> the World hath curſed you, but God hath bleſſed you, yea, and you ſhall be bleſſed: <hi>Come ye and inherit a Kingdom.</hi> I have heretofore told you of a Kingdom promiſed you, a Kingdom you have often prayed for, Lord, <hi>let thy Kingdom come;</hi> come now, my dear Friends, I am come to put you into the poſſeſſion of that Kingdom; I will make you all Kings, and you ſhall reign with me for ever.</p>
                  <p>Great reaſon there is for us to think, that God will take home all his People to himſelf, with abundance of affection, at the laſt day; they are the Sons and Daughters of the Lord God Almighty: and will not our heavenly Father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all his Sons and Daughters to glory with a moſt vehement affection, and take them home to his own Houſe, after a tedious pilgrimage in the World, wherein they have met with harſh unkind uſage? How did <hi>Jacob</hi> tender <hi>Benjamin,</hi> that he would not let him go from him till he was forced to it, and ſaw the neceſſity of it? but his joy is not expreſt upon his return, becauſe he heard that his beloved <hi>Joſeph</hi> was alive, and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:52862:97"/> when he ſaw the Waggons and Charets that <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> had ſent to fetch him and his family into <hi>Egypt.</hi> Oh then it is inconceivable and inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, with what affections our heavenly Father will take home his Children to his everlaſting habitations, when they are of full age, and ready to receive their inheritance. Moreover, they are the temples of the holy Ghoſt; and with what abundance of love (think you) will God receive the Saints, when they are perfumed all over with ſweet odours from Heaven, with all the graces of God's Spirit. The Spirit here is the ſource of all Divine gifts, for being the prime radical donation of our heavenly Father, there is no grace he confers upon us, which bears not the image of this firſt and prime gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity; the Spirit is the <hi>pandora</hi> through which all other bleſſings are beſtowed upon us: Now the Spirit is given to ſanctifie thoſe whom Chriſt hath redeemed, and to preſerve them to God's hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdom, whom Chriſt had purchaſed and delivered from everlaſting deſtruction. God manifeſted much love to his People on Earth, in that his Spirit dwelling in his Saints, when it was often grieved by them, yet would not leave nor quit his old habitation; what abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of love then will he expreſs to them, when he ſhall find nothing in them that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary or diſpleaſing to him? Beſides, the Saints are eſpouſed to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and that great day wherein they are to be received to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:52862:98"/> glory, ſhall be the full conſummation of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; Oh what abundance of love will the Lord Jeſus expreſs to his Bride, when ſhe ſhall be brought home to him after a long time of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration one from another? <hi>With gladneſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing ſhall they be brought unto the King, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kings Palace,</hi> Pſal. 45.15.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:52862:98"/> the Houſe of his Father; and if that word be too ſtrait, into the City of the great King; and if that be too ſtrait, into the World to come, where there ſhall be room enough for them all?</p>
                  <p>What comfort may the meditation hereof afford to you that are poor Chriſtians, that are now the out-caſts of the World? know ye, though the World exclude you, yet Heaven will receive you; though the World afford you no houſe-room, but ſhut you out of doors, yet the everlaſting Gates ſhall be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you, and God ſhall take you into his own Houſe, yea into his own Boſome; ye have a Father in Heaven, his Houſe is richly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and there you ſhall be ſumptuouſly and royally entertained; though the World refuſe to feed you with the crumbs that fall from their tables, yet you ſhall eat and drink with Chriſt at his table in his Kingdom; yea, he ſhall be your meat and drink, who is the bread of life, and the well-ſpring of Salvation: the Lord will think nothing he hath too dear for you, but you ſhall have part with Jeſus Chriſt, and ſhare with him in all his enjoyments. I have read of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who never liked any diſh of meat, but he ſent a part of it from his table to his Friends he loved moſt; yea, ſometimes the very bread and meat he had upon his own trencher, with this kind and friendly ſalutation; Cyrus <hi>tibi iſta quod ipſi fuerint jucundiſſima.</hi> King <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſends you this, becauſe he likes it beſt himſelf, and holds it to be

What tongue or pen is able to ſet forth that large and kind entertainment that God will give to his Children on that day, when they ſhall ſee the Lord Jeſus, like a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Shepherd, conducting all his Flock to the Fold, which was ordained for them before the foundations of the World were laid; when they ſhall ſee him like a valiant General, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Conqueror, riding in the Heavens in the head of his troops and glorious train, who ſhall follow him with Crowns on their heads, and Palm branches in their hands? Oh the ſhout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, oh the ſongs of joy, and vollies of praiſes and Hallelujahs that ſhall fill the World in that great and glorious day, when Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come in his own glory, and in the glory of his Father, and of the holy Angels, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.26.</p>

For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God hath decreed it, and it ſhall certainly come to paſs. <hi>John</hi> 6.39, 40. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>This is the Father's will which hath ſent me, that of all which he hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up again at the last day; and this is the will of him that ſent me, that every one that ſeeth the Son, and believeth in him, may have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, and I will raiſe him up at the last day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt hath promiſed it. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13.14. <hi>I will ranſome them from the power of the grave, I will redeem them from death: O Death, I will be thy plagues; O grave; I will be thy deſtruction.</hi> John 6.54. <hi>Whoſoever eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:52862:100"/> blood, hath eternal life, and I will raiſe him up at the last day:</hi> Yea, Chriſt hath conſidered it by his laſt will and teſtament, <hi>John</hi> 17.22, 24.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is evident by the Saints profeſſion. <hi>Job</hi> confeſſeth thus much plainly, <hi>Job</hi> 19.25. <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand at the latter day upon the earth; and though after my fleſh worms deſtroy this body, yet ſhall I ſee God in my fleſh; whom I myſelf ſhall ſee, mine eyes ſhall behold, and no other for me, though my reins be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed within me.</hi> Our Saviour, who called him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the reſurrection and the life, refutes the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, and confirms the doctrine of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, as to that opinion, producing a place out of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and uſing it as an argument for the proof thereof: As touching the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the dead, have ye not read that which was ſpoken to you by God, ſaying, I am the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the God of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and the God of <hi>Jacob:</hi> God is not the God of the dead, but of the living, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.32. with the weight of which argument he aſtoniſhed the multitude, and ſilenced the Sadduces.

                  <p>I Shall now prove the reſurrection of the Saints bodies by arguments:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Elſe why ſhould the Saints in all ages cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie themſelves to the World, ſuffer afflictions for faith in and hope of the reſurrection? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19. <hi>If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miſerable;</hi> for the wicked eſteem the godly as the moſt miſerable men in the World; and had they only hope of the things of this life, they were then moſt miſerable, foraſmuch as theſe temporal pleaſures are not a ſufficient reward of temporal afflictions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The bodies of the juſt are inſtruments and companions in the work of holineſs, therefore alſo in the reward of them in glory: now if we be dead with Chriſt, we alſo believe that we ſhall live with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.8. without this the bodies of the juſt were of all mens moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the bodies of the wicked ſhall riſe again to receive the reward of condemnation, then by the ſame rule muſt the bodies of the Saints riſe to receive the reward of life and ſalvation. Chriſt ſaith, that the hour is coming when all that are in their graves ſhall hear his voice, and ſhall come forth, they that have done good unto the reſurrection of life, and they that have done evil unto the reſurrection of damnation,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:52862:101"/> 
                     <hi>John</hi> 5.28, 29. if it were not ſo, then God ſhould delight or exceed in juſtice, more then in mercy.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe God is able to raiſe them out of their graves again. As the Lord by the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of dry bones revived the dead hope of Iſrael,<note place="margin">Ezek. 37.10, 11, 12.</note> and made them to know, that he would open their graves, and cauſe them to come out of their graves, and bring them into the Land of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> ſo when the bodies of the Saints go down to the duſt, and their bones are dried there, and their hope ſeems to be loſt, yet then doth their fleſh reſt in hope, for God will not leave them in the grave, nor ſuffer his holy ones always to ſee corruption, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.9, 10.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Otherwiſe the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the loſs of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and Chriſt were not ſo ſtrong to ſave as <hi>Adam</hi> was to deſtroy: <hi>for as in</hi> Adam <hi>all die, even ſo in Christ all ſhall be made alive,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.21, 22. <hi>Adam</hi> was the Author of Death's ſtrength, and Chriſt of Death's reſurrection.</p>

But perhaps it will more gratefully affright you, to ſee a man taught to be buried alive, and (more yet) to out-live his funeral: behold, then <hi>Joſeph,</hi> a moſt excellent type of Chriſt; <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> is baſely betray'd, and ſold by his Brethren into <hi>Egypt;</hi> is falſly accuſed by his Miſtreſs, and caſt into priſon, and after three years impriſonment is delivered; ſo Jeſus is betray'd to the Jews by <hi>Judas,</hi> his own Apoſtle, Friend and Follower, and falſely accuſed before <hi>Pilate</hi> by the Jews, and is put to death; but on the third day <hi>Christ</hi> is raiſed up from the dead: and as <hi>Joſeph</hi> after his deliverance out of priſon is advanced in the

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Sampſon</hi> was alſo a type of Chriſt, as in many things, ſo in theſe two eſpecially, of his his death and reſurrection; for after he had ſlept at <hi>Gaza</hi> (when the Gazites compaſſed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the City, that they might kill him in the morning) he aroſe at midnight, and carried away the gates of the City upon his back, carrying them up to the top of an Hill that is before <hi>Hebron,</hi> carrying away the doors of the gates of the City, and the two poſts, bar and all, upon his ſhoulders: So maugre the watch that the Jews ſet to keep Chriſt's Sepulchre,<note place="margin">Vide <hi>Ferum.</hi> in Matth. <hi>p.</hi> 292.</note> Chriſt aroſe with the myſtical Gates of Hell and Death upon his back (no marvel Hell-gates cannot prevail againſt his Church) together with the Poſts and Pillars thereof: and as <hi>Sampſon</hi> by pulling down the Houſe upon the heads of the Philiſtines, was avenged of his Enemies; ſo Chriſt by opening the ſealed Sepulchre, hath ſubdued Death, yea conquered him in his own Den and Cabin.</p>

But what more proper type can there be then Chriſt makes of himſelf? and that is <hi>Jonas, Matth.</hi> 12.40. which is thus fitted and parallell'd: <hi>Jonah</hi>'s caſting into the Sea was a ſign of Chriſt's Death; his being taken by the Fiſh, and received into his Belly, a ſign of his Burial; and his caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on ſhore again, a ſign of his Reſurrection: Three days he lay in his new night of aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as if he had found an <hi>Egypt</hi> in the belly of the Whale, and did acknowledge the watry Purgatory; at laſt the grave of the Prophet caſts up the living; he had ſurely died, had he not been buried: here's a reſurrection of this rare Anchorite, though not a reviving, for he and his Tomb were both alive: But the Tomb of our Saviour was as deſperate as his Death, yet was it not poſſible that he ſhould be holden of it, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.24. for he aroſe on the third day from the Grave; the Humane Soul of Chriſt did not of it ſelf return and quicken his Body, but his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which reſted, raiſed his Humanity that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; that is, by the vertue and omnipotent power of his God-head, whereby he is able to do all things; he reduced and brought back his reaſonable Soul, and re-united it to his orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Body; and this Body that aroſe was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether glorious, being void of all infirmities and weakneſs whatſoever, being now no more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to hunger, thirſt, cold, wearineſs, or the like. True it is, he called for meat after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.41, 42. and did eat it truly,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:52862:104"/> but not that he needed any meat, or nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his Body being then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal,<note place="margin">Edebat Chriſtus, non ut neceſſitati ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaceret, ſed ut ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem humanae na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae oſtenderet. <hi>Pet. Mart.</hi>
                     </note> and impaſſible, but he doth it to prove himſelf to be really riſen again; for as when he had reſtored others to life, (as <hi>Jairus</hi>'s Daughter, <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and others) to prove that they were truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to life, he cauſed meat to be ſet before them; ſo to manifeſt and declare the truth of his own reſurrection, he calleth for meat, and eateth it before them; and that it might appear there was no falſhood, nor forgery in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he brought not his meat with him, but he takes ſuch things as he found them furniſhed with, and which they had provided; and although he eateth, he doth it not for his own ſake by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the neceſſity of nature, or the infirmity of the fleſh, but for the ſake of his Diſciples; for the ſtrengthening of their faith, and not for the nouriſhing and cheriſhing his own fleſh. Though the neceſſity of eating and drinking in glorified bodies be taken away, ſaith <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> yet it was free, and in his power to eat if he would. <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> tells us, he did ſometimes after his reſurrection, <hi>ad teſtandam veritatem hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani Corporis,</hi> to teſtifie the truth of his humane Body; as namely, his affording himſelf to be ſeen and felt of <hi>Thomas</hi> and others, and his eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking with his Diſciples.

If you demand, what became of the meat that Chriſt did thus eat? I anſwer, it was a moſt eaſie matter for him that made all things of nothing, to cauſe a little meat and drink to conſume and vaniſh to nothing.<note place="margin">

                  <p>BUt will you ſee the manifold proofs of Chriſt's reſurrection? if you will turn over the notes of time, you may believe that <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> as about that time of the year when Chriſt roſe from the dead, was invaded by an hoſt of waves, which conquering his Charets, made him without wheels to hurry faſter into Hell, while <hi>Moſes</hi> led his Iſrael through the Wilderneſs of the Sea, paſſing through the ſhadow of death in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of Waters: Did not our Lord alſo leave his Tomb without an equal and contrary wonder? then the Waters ſeemed to be firm, riſing into Alps, as now the Earth was made to quake like the Waters; and well might the Earth tremble, when the Lord conquered it, and forſook it. The
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:52862:105"/> Angel too made a little Earthquake in the Grave, when he removed the mighty Stone with which the ſenſeleſs Jew tried to oppreſs our Saviour after death, as if he would have ſealed him up to an utter impoſſibility of riſing again; the Earth now moveth and danceth for his exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Stones give place to his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency. The Angel having opened the Tomb, ſhall we look into the place whence Chriſt is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen? but behold, he is not there to be found, an Angel ſupplieth his place, which he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered to obedience, as if he had meant to reſt himſelf in triumph after the conflict of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle; his rayment white as ſnow, which he did imitate in purity; his countenance was like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but more wonderful; for that's of ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant a terror, that it's rather the object of our memory then our eye: but this with a courteous Majeſty was patient to be beheld: the terrified Women quickly behold this ſight, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the Angel, but firſt by their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence: the Souldiers beheld it too, but with ſuch guilty faintneſs, that they ſeemed as much to diſgrace their ſex as their profeſſion, diſarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves at once both of their weapons and ſouls together, they became as breathleſs car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes, and were rather the Captives, then the Keepers of the Grave.</p>
                  <p>But now the Women being comforted, they receive a commiſſion from the Angel to preach the Reſurrection of our Saviour; and out of the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:52862:105"/> Tomb they haſten with the confuſed ſpeed of fear and joy; and while they ſeek the Diſciples, they find their Saviour himſelf, who comforteth them with his preſence and ſpeech, and again ſendeth them to teach his own Diſciples; and to ſhew their obedience to be as quick as their love, they depart from Chriſt to their duty, and ſpeedily find <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> for their Auditors; who no ſooner hear the news of Chriſt's reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, but they run as faſt to the Tomb as the Women ran from it; where no ſooner are they entered, but they perceive Chriſt's victory over Death acknowledged by the Linnen cloathes; his ſpoils of Death, and theſe ſpoils too had been divided, the Napkin off his head being laid up by it ſelf. It ſeems the Angel at our Saviour's reſurrection attended to be a Witneſs of it to the Women, and to leave a teſtimony of it to the Diſciples. Thus that he was not ſtoln away (as was given out) appears by the inconvenience and leiſure of his undreſſing, and by the method of the Linnen, which the affrighted policy of the Souldiers did no more touch then obſerve, and they no more obſerved it then the Women, who after the ſight of the Angel had their eyes as much amazed as their minds; the Souldiers too did more tremble then watch; but the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples had leſs fear, and more time: Beſides, they learnt ſomewhat which they were not taught, and could now teach the Women this news of the Grave, Lo here the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Juda,</hi>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:52862:106"/> whoſe Almighty ſtrength vouchſafed to couch under the power of the Grave; and lo the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his love hath raiſed him up from the ſloth of the Grave.</p>
                  <p>Will ye behold how he was raiſed? behold how the Potter worketh upon the wheel, he taketh clay, he maketh it a veſſel; and this veſſel being made in the hands of the Potter, he makes it again as he beſt pleaſeth. Chriſt was immortal Clay and Earth, purer then Heaven, when by the wonder of Omnipotency, the Creator and Creature were made into one, and of one mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did conſiſt both the Potter and his Pot; from this broken Clay there did ariſe the ſame and a renewed Chriſt. Could any man in this point be yet an Infidel? if any could, ſee how he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts them; he lets <hi>Thomas</hi> diſgrace himſelf to a belief, and by his diſtruſt mercifully and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly encreaſeth his faith. Can any body doubt he was renewed in a Body of glory, when he was full of God? had he not a glorious Body, whom the doors that were ſhut (when he entered to his Diſciples) did obediently acknowledge to be the King of Glory? &amp; though he were patient under Death three days, yet ſince the firſt part of the firſt was ſpent before he died, and the laſt part of the laſt after he revived, there was the number, but not the length of three days; and thus he made ſo ſhort a change, as ſeemed rather a ſleep then death: He roſe not ſooner, leſt he might have been thought not to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This likewiſe declareth his dominion over Sin, Death, Hell, and all Enemies; Chriſt therefore died, roſe again, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living; if he had died, and not riſen again, then had he (at leaſt) ſeemed not to have conquered and overcome death, but to have been foyled in the Field, and overcome of Death; and then how could he have been the death of Death, and the deſtruction of the Grave, and have delivered us from the power of Hell, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13.14. This likewiſe ſheweth us the ſufficiency of his ſatisfaction, and him to be
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:52862:107"/> an abſolute and all-ſufficient Saviour, whereof we might have doubted, had he only died; for we think not a mans debts then paid, when he or his Surety goes to priſon for them, and there abideth, but when he cometh out again with a general diſcharge, ſo that he dares bid defiance to all Bailiffs and Serjeants whatſoever, or who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever can pretend any thing to ſay to him; thus much Chriſt declared to the World by his riſing from the dead, for though he diſcharged our debt by dying, yet we have our acquittance by his riſing again, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25.</p>

                  <p>THere is more excellency of workmanſhip in the Soul, but more variety in the Body; the Soul doth more truly expreſs God, the Body more eaſily; the Soul judgeth beſt, but the Body firſt: and though the eyes of the Soul do behold the work of God more clearly, yet doth the eye of the Body moſt properly. Nay, ſhould not the Body be raiſed to life and Heaven, how great a part of Heaven and that life would be loſt, whiles not enjoyed, and be as unneceſſary
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:52862:110"/> as it is wonderful? God hath prepared joys for the Saints which the eyes have not ſeen, nor the ears heard, but which the eye ſhall ſee, and the ear ſhall hear, and without the pleaſure of a trance for ever poſſeſs, as much without error, as without meaſure; ſuch honour will the Creator of our Bodies do to the Bodies of all his Saints: They ſhall acknowledge Corruption, yet over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it; they may in their journey be the Gueſts of the Grave, but at laſt they ſhall be the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Heaven. Yet the Lord cannot hereafter honour Humane fleſh by raiſing it, as he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready by aſſuming it; it was before his Servant, now his Companion; that was a reſurrection of the fleſh, when it was raiſed unto God, but the only reſurrection of our fleſh is when it is raiſed unto the Soul. At the laſt day of Judgement though there be no Marriage of ſexes, yet there ſhall be of parts; when Souls ſhall be united to Bodies in ſo entire and ſo inexorable a Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that it ſhall admit no hope nor fear of a divorce: nor need we fear in the jealouſie of this Match the Ignoble Parentage of the fleſh, ſince what it wanteth by Birth is ſupplied by Dowry; and fleſh now is become ſuch refined earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made wonderful in ſhape and office, that the Soul may be thought ſcarce more noble, but that it ſeems more reſerved by being inviſible; this mortal body, ſhall put on immortality; this Body ſown in corruption, ſhall be raiſed in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption; it ſhall not only be freed from death,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:52862:110"/> but alſo from corruption, yea, and whatſoever ſavoureth of mortality, or the leaſt decay.</p>
                  <p>And notwithſtanding theſe principles of earth fall into ſuch an heap of duſt, that they are with as much difficulty to be ſeen as numbred; yet thus divided among themſelves, retaining ſtill (though not an appetite, yet) an obedience to a reſurrection: Nature hath not loſt this, and God will ſupply that, and as eaſily unite as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh each duſt; to yield to this is the Creed of the Creed. If any mans faith in the aſſent to this myſtery be as weak as his reaſon, he may help both his faith and his reaſon by ſenſe; by which he ſhall be either convinced or perſwaded. If you will be but as hardy as Antiquity, you may propoſe to your ſelves the ſolemn Poetry of the <hi>Phoenix,</hi> a Creature rarer then the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, though not ſo admirable, in whoſe aſhes you may find the fire of life, expecting but to be fann'd to the reſurrection of a flame; as if this Creature by a riddle of Fate, would by a fire both periſh and revive: But without the courteſie of ſuppoſition, you may in earneſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Eagle ſhoot forth new quills, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with may be written and teſtified his endeavor of immortality: thus doth God teach Nature how to teach us myſteries, and without the magical learning of the language of Birds, to underſtand without their voice their ſecret inſtruction. But perhaps you will think that to diſcern this truth in the nature of Eagles, would require a ſight
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:52862:111"/> as ſharp as the Eagles. Remove then your eyes from the Fowls of the Air, but to the Trees whereon they neſt, and with a negligent view you may obſerve, how after the nakedneſs and death of Winter, they bud forth afreſh into life and beauty; yet why ſhould we in the ſloth of this eaſie contemplation, ſtudy ſo broad an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject? let our eye with more grateful induſtry confine it ſelf with the ſmall ſeed of corn, and (at leaſt) take the pains to ſee the pains of the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman; and ſhall we not admire at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Arithmatick of nature, to behold a ſeed, whoſe hope ſeems as ſmall as it ſelf, by being caſt away, to be found by deſtruction to receive increaſe, from the ſame furrow to take both a Burial and a Birth? He that ſhall now ſee a little drop of man's ſeed in a glaſs, and a lump of earth together, would think the one as unlikely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a man as the other; and yet we ſee how miraculous and curious a work the Lord makes every day of the principle of ſeed; which made <hi>David</hi> cry out, <hi>I am fearfully and wonderfully made,</hi> Pſal. 139. and he can eaſily reſtore our Bodies out of a praeexiſtent ſomething, which may confute the erronious opinion of the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, who denied the reſurrection, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.23. of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Philoſophers, who derided it, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.18. holding the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> tranſmigration; of <hi>Himeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> who ſaid the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was paſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.18. and laſtly, of all thoſe Atheiſts and Epicures, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 22.13. that

                  <p>BUt now the Soul will have its old Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion again; for ſhould the Soul for ever want the Body, it ſhould want both perfection and wonder: Is not the Soul moſt perfect when it is moſt noble? is it not moſt noble when it is moſt bountiful? and is it not moſt bountiful when it gives life to the dead? Is it not likewiſe moſt full of wonder, when it is thus perfect in that which is imperfect? when it mixeth with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and yet is incorruptible? when it is moſt burthened, and yet is moſt variouſly active? Thus by this neceſſary inclination of the Soul, the Reſurrection is as natural in reſpect of the union, as it is above Nature in reſpect of the manner.</p>
                  <p>But now ſee the curious zeal of the Soul; it will not only have a Body again, but, in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe ſociety, it will have only its own again: not any other new created Bodies, but the ſame nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical and ſubſtantial Bodies ſhall riſe again, and be re-united to their proper Souls. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.53, 54. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Job</hi> 19.26, 27.

                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:52862:112"/> There may be ſome general alteration in reſpect of their ſtature, deformities, ſuperfluities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to a glorified perfection; but ſtill it ſhall remain the ſame eſſential Body, and good reaſon there is for it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The juſtice of God requireth, that the ſame Body which hath been inſtrumental in the actions of righteouſneſs, or unrighteouſneſs, ſhould be rewarded, or puniſhed: The Godly muſt receive their rewards according to what good they have done in theſe Bodies, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10.

                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe if God ſhould not raiſe the very ſame Bodies of his People, in which they lived and ſerved God in their generation, then God ſhall not deal ſo honourably with the dead Saints, as with thoſe that ſhall be found alive at Chriſt's coming; for their very ſame Bodies ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the bondage of mortality and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, into incorruption and immortality.</p>

                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:52862:112"/>3. Becauſe Chriſt, who is the pattern of the reſurrection, did not riſe in another Body, but in that in which he was faſtened to the Croſs; in which alſo after his death appeared the prints of the nails in his hands, and the holes in his ſide, <hi>John</hi> 20.27. Therefore Chriſt after his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for the cure of <hi>Thomas</hi> his unbelief, (whoſe faith lay in his fingers) bids him put his finger into his hands and ſide, and not be faithleſs, but believing. It ſeems thoſe ſcars remained in Chriſt's Body after his reſurrection,<note place="margin">Vulnerum ſigna, virtutum inſignia. <hi>Aquinas.</hi>
                     </note> elſe how could <hi>Thomas</hi> ſee and feel them as he is willed to do? But theſe ſcars were no blemiſhes in his Body then; they were no ſigns of defect, but enſigns of Victory: For as that worthy and renowned Captain <hi>Caius Marius,</hi> being on a time accuſed of Treaſon in the Senate, tore his clothes, and ſhewed his wounds and ſcars, and ſlaſhes he had received in the Wars, in the ſervice and for the ſafety of his Country, ſaying, <hi>Quid opus est Verbis, Vulnera clamant?</hi> What need is there of my Words, my Wounds cry loud enough? So Chriſt might ſhew his pierced Side, goared Hands and Feet, not only to ſhew that it was the very ſame organical Body of his that was crucified on the Croſs, but alſo to ſhew his love to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and what he did and ſuffered for them. And when the eleven Diſciples were gathered together at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Jeſus appeared to them; and they being affrighted, ſuppoſing they had
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:52862:113"/> ſeen a Spirit, he ſaid unto them, <hi>Why are ye trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled? and why do thoughts ariſe in your hearts? Behold my hands and my feet; it is I my ſelf: a Spirit hath not fleſh and bones as ye ſee me to have,</hi> Luke 24.39, 40. A Spirit hath not parts, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and dimenſions, as I have; therefore you may be ſure, being infallibly taught by your ſenſe, that it is my very Body which you ſee, in which I long converſed with you, ſuffered, and was buried, which is now truly riſen again: Whence, as <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſaith, he proveth it was his true Body that was crucified on the Croſs, that was now raiſed from the dead.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Should not the Saints riſe with the ſame Bodies, it were no reſurrection, but a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Moreover, the ſame Souls do riſe unto Grace; from the death of Sin, to the life of Righteouſneſs; which is called in Scripture, <hi>the first Reſurrection,</hi> Rev. 20.6. therefore the ſame Body ſhall riſe unto Glory in the ſecond Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
                  <p n="5">5, Conſider that Death in Scripture is called a Sleep, a Dream; and the Reſurrection, an awaking from Sleep, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 17. <hi>ult.</hi> therefore as the ſame Body that lies down to ſleep at night awaketh in the morning, ſo the ſame Body that lies down to ſleep in the duſt, ſhall awake and riſe again in the morning of the Reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>Hence we ſee that the Soul will have its own numerical Body again, for the preſerving of ſuch numerical identity; there ſhall be wonderfully
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:52862:113"/> reſtored the ſubſtantial union, which is but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally diſtinguiſhed from the parts united; there ſhall be reſtored a perſonality, and laſtly the native temperament, which doth contain the individuating diſpoſitions, whereby ſuch a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath a peculiar appetite to ſuch a form; which matter, by vertue of ſuch inclination, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains (as formerly) the ſame, though it may be varied by extenſion; as when the Infant ſhall be raiſed into a Man, the perſon ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, but not multiplied.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But that of the Apoſtle may be objected, who ſaith, That fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.50.</p>

                  <p>ANd we may moſt eaſily remember by whom we riſe, by remembring him by whom we fell; yet if we behold the original of their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, we ſhall find they were both without ſin; and that the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had his beſt Paradiſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf, but when he was fallen by the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Woman, that was made for his help; never did Woman prove a ſtrong help to Man, before the Virgin-mother of Chriſt, God and Man: then though the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had eaten up the fatal Apple, the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> ſwallowed up Death; he had before made the poor Man take up the Bed of his ſickneſs and walk, but he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was the firſt that ever took up Death's Bed and walked. Yet ſome before our Saviour bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed a fantaſtical reſurrection, as <hi>Saul</hi>'s equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal <hi>Samuel;</hi> and ſome roſe again in earneſt, but to die again in earneſt, as ſupererrogating <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that paid to nature one death more then he owed: but our Lord Jeſus is riſen with as much perfection as power, and with as much power as love and glory.</p>
                  <p>The Poetical Chymick tells us plainly of an Alchymiſtical man at the Earth's centre, who by a ſpherical diffuſion of his vertue, doth, like a ſubterranean Sun, improve Mettals to a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſis; which as it is bold in the Fable, ſo by a devout mithology may be modeſt in the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:52862:116"/> moral: this ſecret Workman ſhall be our Saviour, whoſe vertue was diſperſed into the bowels of the Grave, that at his reſurrection he improved Carcaſſes into Saints, who roſe with him, went into the holy City, and appeared unto many, as the Witneſſes and Attendants of his power, of which ſomething hath been already ſpoken: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to advance the head without the members were ſo unnatural, that it were rather like an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution then preferment; and it were ſtranger to ſee a Captain, or Leader, without his Souldiers, then without his Arms: Beſides, were it fit, when the Maſter is riſen, the Servant ſhould lie ſtill? thus then they were raiſed, as much to holineſs as to life; it was not only a reſurrection, but a conſecration, and Chriſt was the firſt-fruits of them that roſe; he had the precedency both in order and vertue.</p>
                  <p>The firſt-fruits under the Law were the firſt handful, as acceptible as ripe, by a bountiful me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation obtaining holineſs and entertainment for the reſt: this firſt offering did commend it ſelf to the Lord, rather by the ſpeed then the quantity; the Jew offered this at his own home, and it was as domeſtick as his thoughts; being a preſent of eloquent ſimplicity, which at the ſame time did honour and overcome the Almighty. Oh how our Saviour made this figure ſolid, when at once he conquered for us Death and Heaven, as I may ſo ſpeak: He was but the firſt handful of Corn, and yet as powerful as ſmall, making all
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:52862:116"/> the reſt of a like holineſs, though not of an equal.</p>
                  <p>But there were greater firſt-fruits which the Jews went to pay at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and as the firſt were an offering of humility, ſo thoſe of pomp: <hi>Thoſe</hi> did more ſet forth the thankfulneſs of the Labourer, and <hi>theſe</hi> the magnificence of the Lord. If you will take the words of the Rabbins, (whom in ſtory of cuſtom we have no more cauſe to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt then to feign) they will tell you, when the Huſbandman carried up thoſe Fruits to the holy City, he had a Bull went before him, whoſe horns were guilded, and an Olive-garland upon his head; this was the picture of his Maſter's affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and ſtate: as if by the impetuous Beaſt, he would expreſs the courage of his joy; by guilded horns, the riches of his plenty; and by the Olive-garland, the Crown of peace: Behold the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played Herauldry of his happineſs! and that it might be increaſed by applauſes, a Pipe played before him, to charge all to take notice of it, until they came to the Mountain of the Lord. Shall not theſe firſt-fruits be likewiſe paid at our great reſurrection? ſhall they not be brought to our heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the City of the great King? ſhall they not have Angels go before them? ſhall there not likewiſe be Crowns? and ſhall they not likewiſe be uſhered by the voice of a Trumpet? It was the ſound that the Jews uſed at their braver Funerals, and may it not then fitly be uſed, when they ſhall be awaked from their Tombs?</p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:52862:117"/>
                  <p>Till Chriſt was riſen, thoſe that were buried were dead; but if we once but name him the firſt-fruits of them that riſe, let us no more ſay, that they are dead, but that they ſleep: yet all before the reſurrection ſhall not ſleep; ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of riſing, ſhall be only new dreſſed, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloathed with incorruption, and ſo have ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a change of rayment, then of life; they ſhall not put off their bodies, but their mortality; and be made like unto Chriſt, both in the truth of the reſurrection, and of glory. The <hi>Eutychian</hi> ſhall then confeſs, that the two natures in Chriſt are not mixed, though joyned; and that his Humanity (though exalted) is not changed: the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> ſhall then recover the poſſeſſion and acquaintance of his vagabond Soul; the <hi>Sadduce</hi> ſhall then riſe in that body, in which he denied the reſurrection of the body; and with the eyes of his body ſee the errour of his Soul; the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitary</hi> ſhall then ſee that Chriſt's body may be ſeen, and it ſhall certainly prove that it is not everywhere, by being not in the ſame grave whence it was riſen; that is, in reſpect of his corporal preſence, for otherwiſe (as he is God) he was there, and in all other places of the World.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. I.</hi> Of the glory of the Bodies of the Saints in Heaven, and first of the beauty and clarity of glorified Bodies.</head>
                  <p>BUt now to ſpeak more particularly of the glory of the Body: the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.43. <hi>the Body is ſown in diſhonour, it is raiſed in glory:</hi> that which is here called <hi>glory,</hi> is by Divines generally termed <hi>clarity;</hi> and this no way varying from the ſenſe of the Apoſtle; for <hi>verſ.</hi> 41, 42. he ſaith, that the glories of the Saints Bodies in Heaven, at the general reſurrection, ſhall be different and divers; one exceeding another in clarity, as one Star differs from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in glory; ſo ſhall the reſurrection of the dead be. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Christ ſhall change our vile bodies, and faſhion them like unto his glorious body.</hi> This is very admirable, that a poor ſinful Creature ſhould be ſo changed, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, exalted, as to be like the Son of God in glory: Our Bodies now are but as loathſome Carcaſſes; what a vile Body had <hi>Job</hi> when he ſate upon the Dunghil? what a vile Body had <hi>Lazarus</hi> when he lay at the Rich Man's gate full of ſores? When Children are young, break out in the face, in hands and body, there is no beauty in them; ſo ſin breaks out in theſe
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:52862:118"/> mortal Bodies, and makes them ugly in God's eyes; there are many corporal imperfections in mens Bodies now, but when Chriſt ſhall appear, then our Bodies ſhall be as his Body, beautiful and glorious. Tradition upheld by reaſon teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, that he was beautiful without art; that the Holy Ghoſt who formed his Body in the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins Womb, would have it adorned with comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; he conſecrated beauty in his Perſon, when he took our nature upon him; though he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the pain of ſin, he would not aſſume the uglineſs thereof; and as there was no ignorance in his Soul, ſo was there no deformity in his Body. His very types in the Old Teſtament were all comely: <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> the one of which repreſented his Victories, the other his Triumphs, were both of them famous for their beauty; the Angels took upon them his viſage when they treated with the Prophets; while they ſpoke in his name, they would appear in his form. <hi>Jacob</hi> had the honour to ſee him, when he wreſtled with him before the break of day; the three Children that were thrown into the fiery Furnace ſaw him in the midſt of the flames: But how gloriouſly did the face of Chriſt ſhine at his Transfiguration? Chriſt's face did ſhine upon Earth, and now in Heaven doth ſhine like the Sun. And our Saviour intimateth, that <hi>the Righteous ſhall ſhine as the Sun in the Kingdom of their Father,</hi> Matth. 13.43. <hi>Lazarus</hi> his Body ſhall be a beautiful Body, he ſhall have no imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:52862:118"/> 
                     <hi>Sampſon</hi> ſhall then have his eyes which the Philiſtines pulled out; <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> ſhall not be lame in Heaven; there ſhall be no imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in a glorified Body. The Scripture mentioneth ſome Perſons eminent for beauty, as <hi>David, Joſeph,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Abſalom,</hi> who (though he had a deformed Soul, yet) for his out-ſide, was without blemiſh, and had no peer among thoſe many thouſands of Iſrael: <hi>There was none to be ſo much praiſed for beauty as</hi> Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom, <hi>for from the ſoles of his feet to the crown of his head, there was no blemiſh in him,</hi> 2 Sam. 14.25. But the moſt exquiſite earthly beauty is but ſkin-deep, and but like the painting of a rotten poſt; it is but a freſh colour laid on mortality; the foundation of it is weak and craſie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſoon fadeth: but he that is like to Chriſt in holineſs, ſhall be like to him in heavenly beauty and glory; the beauty of glorified Bodies ſhall be a ſhining beauty. The expreſſion of Divines is thus; As Iron when it is heated in the Fire, we cannot ſee the Iron for the Fire, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears nothing elſe but fiery; ſo in Heaven we ſhall not be able to ſee the Body for the glory thereof: and as the Air is now fully poſſeſſed with the light, ſo ſhall our Bodies be fully poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with glory; and the Soul full of the light of glory ſhall be diffuſed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the whole Body,<note place="margin">

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:52862:119"/> that the whole Body be reſplendent, according to the dignity of the Soul inhabiting it. Yea, it is conceived that the glory of the Soul ſhall be ſeen through the Body, in ſuch a ſort as the life of the Soul is ſeen and obſerved in and by the vivacity and livelineſs which it imparts by action and motion to the outward viſible parts of the Body:<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Rich.

                  <p>THe Bodies of the Saints in Heaven ſhall alſo have a wonderful agility, whereby they ſhall be able to move from place to place with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible ſwiftneſs; this agility is a glorious quality, whereby the Bodies of the glorified are totally ſubject to the Souls, as to moſt powerful movers, to be moved by them without the leaſt reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or reſiſtance; for the Soul ſhall then (as ſome Learned men ſay) have a moſt abſolute domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over the Body, and by a redundancy and emanation, impart to it a glorious quickning and vivacity, far beyond that which any mortal Creatures in their bodily heavy parts can have; for glorified Souls ſhall then be made perfect, and glorified Bodies ſhall have more perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments for motion, then thoſe which corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Bodies uſually have, and the weight of their Bodies ſhall not in the leaſt hinder their motion. And albeit the ſame Father ſaith, <hi>Certe ubi volet Spiritus, ibi protinus erit Corpus;</hi> that the Body will preſently be there where the Soul would have it: Yet may we not grant unto the ſame Bodies any inſtantanean motion, ſo that in an
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:52862:120"/> imagined inſtant of time, they may make any true real corporal motion; for time in a proper ſpeech hath no true or real inſtant, either as part, or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, or end of it ſelf; for then a glorified Body muſt paſs thorow the beginning, middle, and end of a ſpace at once, if it move from place to place in an inſtant, which were more then utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, involving a contradiction, and would be deſtructive to the nature of a true Body.</p>
                  <p>Yet the motion of glorified Bodies may be very ſudden, and in ſo ſhort a time (as it were) imperceptible. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares it to the Sun-beams,<note place="margin">

Moreover, which way ſoever they ſhall move, they ſhall have the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious preſence of God with them: in Heaven the

                  <p>A Farther degree of the happineſs of a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Body is, that it ſhall be ſpiritual: <hi>It is ſown a natural Body, but it riſeth a ſpiritual Body,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.44. It is called a ſpiritual Body, not as though the Body were changed into the Soul and Spirit; for ſo, that which is raiſed ſhould not be Man, conſiſting of a Soul and Body, but a third diſtinct thing differing from Man: it ſhall not then ceaſe to be a Body; it ſhall change condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but not change nature; were its nature changed, the myſtery of the reſurrection of the fleſh ſhould be quite taken away, and ſo the ſame thing that fell ſhould not be raiſed again: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it called a ſpiritual Body, as though the Body after the reſurrection were rarified like the Air and Wind, as the Eutychians of old affirmed, denying glorified Bodies to be palpable: but I call it ſpiritual,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe as the Body ſhall be re-united to the Soul, ſo it ſhall be perfectly ſubmitted to it;
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:52862:121"/> as the Spirit ſerving the Fleſh, may not unfitly be called <hi>carnal,</hi> ſo the Body obedient to the Soul, is rightly termed <hi>ſpiritual:</hi> The Soul ſhall have a more powerful influence upon, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the Body after the reſurrection, then it ever had, or could have, in the time of her mortality; it ſhall no longer be the Priſon, but the Temple of the Soul; then the Body ſhall readily yield to every motion of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Body ſhall be endued with ſpiritual properties; the Bodies of the Saints ſhall be even as the Angels are now in Heaven, they ſhall be able to live without ſleep, without eating and drinking, without marriage; they ſhall need none of ſuch things as theſe natural Bodies in this mortal condition do: Our Bodies now are but ſo many clogs to our Souls, ſubject to toyl and wearineſs; but then the Body will have ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, as will free and clear it from all ſuch corporal imperfections and defections, as bodily and corporal ſubſtances are obnoxious to; the corruptible Body overladeth and oppreſſeth the Soul, and this earthly tabernacle preſſeth down the mind meditating on heavenly things; but in Heaven, when the Souls of the Bleſſed ſhall ſee the glory of God, and be for ever in the contemplation of him, they ſhall then be freed from all clogs and hinderances, that ſo they may bend themſelves with all their might to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, love, and fruition of God, whoſe goodneſs will then be moſt clearly and fully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to them.</p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:52862:121"/>
                  <p>But as for <hi>ſubtilty,</hi> which properly ſignifies a property, whereby ſuch things as are ſpiritual have a penetrative vertue to paſs through the corpulent parts of any thing that hath a Body, having parts and dimenſions, I cannot ſee how it can be attributed to glorified Bodies, which after the reſurrection ſhall have the ſame exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and bodily parts for quantity and material ſubſtance as they had before, and can no more pierce thorow any true bodily ſubſtance which hath the dimenſions of quantity (as length, breadth, thickneſs) then they could before their reſurrection, during the time of their mortality and corruption. Although divers of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents affirm, that Chriſt after his reſurrection, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the room where his Diſciples were, the doors being ſhut, <hi>John</hi> 20.26. by paſſing thorow the door; yet if it were ſo, we may not attribute the ſame as a thing natural to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Body, it having the ſame dimenſions of quantity for fulneſs of matter it had before, but muſt rather be attributed to the power of his God-head, to whom nothing is impoſſible: but I ſuppoſe, though the doors were ſhut preſently before and after his paſſage, yet they opened of their own accord, or by his Divine power at the inſtant of his paſſage, as <hi>Acts</hi> 12.10. the Creature giving place to the Creator; otherwiſe we muſt hold the Body of Chriſt made a penetration tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the doors, and then there muſt be two ſolid Bodies in one place at the ſame time, which were
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:52862:122"/> impoſſible. And St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, even of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Bodies, <hi>Tolle ſpatia corporibus, &amp; corpora non erunt;</hi> take away ſpaces from the Bodies, and they will ceaſe to be bodies.</p>

                  <p>MOreover the Bodies of the Saints in glory ſhall be made impaſſible; in this life we are ſubject to many infirmities, to thouſands of miſeries; our Bodies are Butts, againſt which miſeries and afflictions (which are the Arrows of the Almighty) are ſhot; but glorified Bodies are ſubject to none of theſe, they ſuffer no pain, Chriſt will wipe away all tears from their eyes; ſorrow and mourning ſhall flee away, and be ſent packing to Hell among the Devils and damned Wretches, their afflictions are their portion: Heaven and the bleſſed ſtate of the Saints in Heaven, is as free from miſery as from ſin; this World to the godly, is as the Priſon to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Furnace to the three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as the Lions Den to <hi>Daniel:</hi> this World to the godly is like an Houſe of Correction, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is much toyl and labour, and very much ſcourging beſides: We are born to be miſerable, we ſhall do nothing elſe but ſuffer; but we ſhall be taken out of Priſon, our Bodies ſhall be drawn out of the Furnace, freed from the Houſe of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:52862:122"/> Correction, and no grief nor miſery ſhall ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more touch our glorified Bodies. Their impaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility will then free them from all the injuries of the Elements; the natural heat which now waſteth them, ſhall no more conſume the natural moyſture; the contraries that compoſe man will then agree; and the Body being no longer tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with hunger and thirſt, will ſtand in need neither of meat nor drink, he will be in a ſtate of conſiſtency, wherein he will have his juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. The Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>what is ſown in weakneſs, ſhall be raiſed in power and vertue;</hi> ſo that the Body ſhall not need that propping up, as the weak pillars thereof do now need ſupport in this ſtate of mortality. But this power is no ſupernatural vertue, making the elementary parts and qualities to be of another nature then now they are, for there muſt be no change nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, but only a perfection of Nature; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall theſe elementary qualities, by the power of God, be limited or obſtructed in their operations, that they ſhall not fight againſt each other to their mutual deſtruction; for then the impaſſibility of glorified Bodies ſhould not be an internal vertue, as abiding in the Body (which is againſt the Apoſtle's intent) but only an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal aſſiſtance of God. <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>SECT. V.</hi> Of the incorruptibility and immortality of glorified Bodies.</head>
                  <p>FInally, the glory of the Body ſhall be ſo firm and ſtable, that it can never wither or decay, it ſhall be incorruptible: <hi>The Body is ſown in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, it is raiſed in incorruption,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.42. <hi>This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality,</hi> verſe 53. The Bodies of the beatified ſhall then be embalmed with the Spirit, that ſhall cauſe them for ever to be incorruptible; their Bodies ſhall be made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible and immortal, like the glorious Body of Chriſt; theſe earthly Tabernacles, or <hi>demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilia Animae,</hi> muſt be taken down, and then theſe Bodies of duſt muſt return to duſt; we muſt ſay to Corruption, thou art our Mother, and to the Worm, thou art our Siſter; and the Soul muſt ſuffer a divorce from the Body: But when Chriſt ſhall appear, our mortality ſhall be ſwallowed up of life, then our corruption ſhall put on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption; theſe vile duſty Bodies of ours ſhall
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:52862:123"/> be made glorious Manſions for our Souls, and our Souls ſhall be for ever united to our Bodies again, ſo that they ſhall never ſuffer a divorce from the Body, and the Body ſhall never ſee corruption any more. We ſhall then enjoy an eternal ſpring of years which ſhall never wither; our days will paſs on, yet ſhall we never feel any decay or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion in our ſelves; our budding verdure will fear no Winter, the Lillies and Roſes of our Countenances will keep their freſhneſs; and as original Righteouſneſs ſerved to Man as a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the ſtate of Innocence, ſo Glory will be inſtead of a Robe to the Bleſſed. God hath made the Soul of ſo powerful a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">

                  <p>ALbeit glorified Bodies ſhall be impaſſible, and incorruptible, ſo that they ſhall not be ſubject to any contrary or violent impreſſions, yet may we not deny, but that there ſhall be ſuch ſenſitive actions of ſeeing, hearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and conſequently anſwerable paſſions which include not corruption, as may be fitting for that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious place; each ſenſe ſhall there have its own proper delight and glory: doubtleſs the Bodies of the Saints ſhall not be deſtitute of their ſenſes, but be compleatly furniſhed with moſt perfect organs and ſpirits fit for their uſe, and therefore ſhall have the moſt perfect uſe of their ſenſes; and verily in vain ſhould the Body be reſumed, if there might not be the uſe and delight of the ſenſes, ſeeing the Body of man is not neceſſary or uſeful to the Soul, but for the uſe of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; neither ſhall there be wanting objects which may be perceived, and may delight and refreſh the ſenſes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Soul is not only rational, but alſo ſenſitive, and in both parts is capable of taking its delights; therefore it muſt not only be made happy in the rational part (which ſhall be done by the viſion and fruition of God) but alſo in the ſenſitive part, which ſhall be brought to paſs by the perception of the moſt excellent ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible objects fitted to every ſenſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:52862:124"/>2. The Saints in this life had many grievous afflictions and mortifications, for Chriſt's ſake, in their ſenſes; for the greateſt part of the torments which the holy Martyrs endured, was in their ſenſes: <hi>They were tortured; they had trial of cruel mockings and ſcourgings; yea moreover, of bonds and impr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſonments: they were ſtoned, they were ſawn aſunder, they were ſlain with the ſword; they wandered about in ſheep-skins and goat-skins, being deſtitute, afflicted, tormented,</hi> Heb. 11.36, 37. And the greateſt part of the work of mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation lies in the mortification of the ſenſes; there is by nature an inordinateneſs in all our outward and inward ſenſes: thence we read in Scripture of <hi>a wanton eye,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 21.7. of <hi>itching ears,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.11. <hi>the lust of the palate, Numb.</hi> 11.4, 5. of <hi>the lust of the noſe, Prov.</hi> 7.18. ſo <hi>of the touch, Prov.</hi> 7.13. ſo that we cannot with ſafety truſt them without <hi>Job</hi>'s covenant, <hi>Job</hi> 31.1. or the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi>'s hedge, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.6. or <hi>Solomon</hi>'s knife, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.7. or <hi>David</hi>'s bridle, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 39.1. Not only the rational and intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, but alſo the whole ſenſitive part of man is ſubject to luſt, and much of the work of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification lies in ſubduing the inordinateneſs of the bodily ſenſes; ſo in Heaven likewiſe, the ſenſitive parts and faculties which have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of the Soul in the exerciſes of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and in ſuffering for righteouſneſs ſake, ſhall alſo receive their appointed rewards and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:52862:125"/> conſolations, which ſhall be accommodated to every one of the ſenſes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This is confirmed by the contrary, for the damned in Hell ſhall be greatly tormented in all their ſenſes; the wanton eyes ſhall always be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with the ſight of ugly Devils which ſhould they behold here when they are alone, would almoſt ſcare them out of their wits; the delicate ears ſhall be affrighted with the horrid noiſe of damned Ghoſts, crying and roaring out with doleful ſhriekings, curſing the day that ever they were born; they ſhall famiſh and pine away for ever, without one bit of bread to ſtanch their hunger, and without one drop of water to cool their tongues, tormented in the infernal flames: your dainty delicate perſons, that now cannot brook the leaſt unſavoury ſmell, ſhall lie down in a ſtinking dungeon, in a loathſome lake, that burns with fire and brimſtone for ever. Now if the Damned in Hell ſhall be ſo grievouſly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in their ſenſes, then ſhall the ſenſes of the glorified Saints be exceedingly refreſhed; for God is not more ſevere in puniſhing, then boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in rewarding.</p>

                  <head>SECT. VII.</head>
                  <p>HEre let us conſider ſome of the particular Senſes, and parts of the Body, and take notice what notable things might be ſpoken of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="227" facs="tcp:52862:125"/>1. The Eyes, thoſe windows in the upper ſtory, how lightſome ſhall they be? and what high and glorious objects ſhall they behold? the Eyes ſhall then be renewed, and made more bright and clear then the light of the Sun; the very act of ſeeing ſhall be moſt clear and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, they ſhall be freed from all darkneſs, dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, obſcurity and defect; no glorious object ſhall dazle the eyes of the Inhabitants in Heaven, for the brightneſs of the heavenly Bodies ſhall not trouble the ſpirits of the eyes, (as the light of the Sun troubleth them now) but ſhall moſt ſweetly ſtrengthen them.</p>
                  <p>We may conceive that thoſe that are in this place of bleſſedneſs, at one ſingle aſpect may perfectly ſee from one end of the Heaven to the other, there being no defect in the objects, <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> or <hi>organ,</hi> or any thing to intercept the ſight, the objects being ſo tranſparent and glorious; here we may ſee a Star in a dark night at many thouſand miles diſtance: but as the objects in Heaven ſhall be moſt glorious, ſo the eyes of the Saints ſhall be enabled perfectly to behold them. Again, the <hi>medium</hi> ſhall no way be defective; here the thickneſs or darkneſs of the Air often dulls our ſight, but in Heaven there ſhall be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a perfect ſerenity round about them: as in Hell is utter darkneſs, ſo in Heaven there ſhall be moſt perfect light. The <hi>organ</hi> alſo, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of ſight, [the eye] ſhall be wholly free from all dimneſs, and be able to diſcern any
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:52862:126"/> glorious object preſented to it; it ſhall be free from weakneſs, able to bear the brighteſt ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor; nor ſhall it be any way offended with the glory of any viſible thing, though never ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendently glorious. I ſhall now ſpeak of the glorious objects which the bodily eye ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. It ſhall behold the glory of God himſelf, in a moſt glorious manifeſtation of himſelf to it. It is a queſtion whether we ſhall ſee God with our bodily eyes: But I will not burden you with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of opinions, but take theſe things in anſwer to the queſtion.</p>
                  <p>The ſight of God in Heaven is to be referred to the underſtanding; to the eye of the mind, not to the eye of the body. The Reaſons of it are theſe:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe the Divine Eſſence is moſt ſpiritual, therefore it altogether exceeds the power of bodily eyes, though glorified, and raiſed to a far more admirable ability to diſcern far above what now it poſſibly can ſee: <hi>Potentia organica ultra corpora non potest extendi;</hi> by the ſight of ſenſe, with our bodily eyes we can only ſee corporal things, and materially bodily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and ſo we cannot ſee our own Souls, much leſs the Eſſence and Subſtance of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith of God, that he is abſolutely inviſible, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. <hi>whom no eye hath ſeen, nor can ſee;</hi> namely, with bodily eyes. And though it be ſaid of <hi>Jacob,</hi> that <hi>he ſaw
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:52862:126"/> God face to face,</hi> Geneſ. 32. and that <hi>God talked with</hi> Moſes <hi>mouth to mouth, as a man talketh with his friend,</hi> Numb. 13. yet they ſaw not God in his nature, eſſence, and ſubſtance, wherein he is inviſible, but in ſome viſible created form which it pleaſed him to aſſume, and wherein he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to them. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſaith, that they ſaw God in ſome manifeſtations of himſelf, but not in his own nature: ſo it is conceived that the Servants of God, even after this life, when they be perfectly ſanctified and glorified, ſhall not ſee God the Father and the Holy Ghoſt in their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, for they ſhall ſtill have their true bodies, and true eyes, and therefore they ſhall ſee but their proper objects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Becauſe the Angels, who have no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily eyes, and ſtand continually before the Lord, and the bleſſed Souls of Saints in Heaven do now ſee God, and yet have no bodily eyes; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their ſight of God is only mental, not ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. Becauſe the Apoſtle expreſſeth the ſeeing God face to face by perfect knowledge, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. <hi>Now we ſee through a glaſs darkly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then ſhall I know even as alſo I am known:</hi> where to know God as he knows us, is to ſee him face to face.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Although we ſhall not ſee God with our bodily eyes, yet notwithſtanding the glorified organ of a glorified body, informed by a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:52862:127"/> Soul, ſhall have moſt glorious objects to look upon in Heaven; as</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Heaven it ſelf is a moſt glorious ſight for our glorified eyes; what a glorious ſight is the outſide of Heaven, bedeckt with the Sun, Moon, and innumerable Stars? if the outſide be ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, what is the inſide, wherein the glory of God is diſplayed? if the porch and pavement of this Palace be ſo glorious, what then is the Preſence-Chamber? It was <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s wiſh, that he could ſee Chriſt in the fleſh, <hi>Paul</hi> in the pulpit, <hi>Rome</hi> in her glory: In Heaven you ſhall ſee Chriſt, not in his ſtate of humiliation, but in the higheſt degree of glory; not <hi>Paul</hi> in the Pulpit, but <hi>Paul</hi> ſitting on a Throne of glory; not <hi>Rome,</hi> but Heaven it ſelf, the heavenly <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> in its fulneſs of glory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Theſe eyes of our bodies ſhall ſee the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious man Chriſt Jeſus, in whoſe Humane nature (as in a glaſs) God will in an ineffable manner manifeſt the glory of his Divine eſſence; hence the Apoſtle calls him <hi>the brightneſs of his perſon;</hi> the beam, the ſplendour of his perſon: In <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.23. it is ſaid, <hi>The City hath no need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to ſhine in it; for the Glory of God doth lighten it, and the Lamb is the light there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:</hi> that is, Chriſt himſelf is the light by which we ſhall ſee God. Oh what a glorious raviſhing object will Chriſt's body be to the eye? A Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher was ſo raviſhed with the Sun, that he thought himſelf made for no other end but to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:52862:127"/> look upon the Sun. Chriſt's Body in Heaven is a thouſand times more bright then the Sun;<note place="margin">Non in forma ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi, ſed in forma.</note> the Sun is black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of darkneſs in compariſon of it: here we ſee Chriſt as he will manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to us otherwiſe, but there <hi>we ſhall ſee him as he is,</hi> 1 John 3.2. <hi>Ferus</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the words thus <hi>[we ſhall know him as he is]</hi> that is,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ferus</hi> in 1 Joan. 3.2.</note> ſaith he, we ſhall know Chriſt no more under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Servant; we ſhall not know Chriſt as the Son of Man, but then we ſhall know him as God, as he is the Son of God, the King of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſtate, the Lord of glory. <hi>Cajetan</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cajetan.</hi> in loc.</note> ſaith, that this particle <hi>[ſicut]</hi> as he is, <hi>excludit omnem viſionem per repreſentans,</hi> excludeth our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt from any thing that repreſents him <hi>ſed ſicuti est, ſicut ipſe ſeipſum offert: (i. e.)</hi> we ſhall know him by himſelf, and not by the creature, or any thing whatſoever. Much of Chriſt is diſcovered here in the Word, in the the Goſpel, and in the Ordinances; and great manifeſtations of Chriſt are made to the Souls of his People by the Spirit of Wiſdom and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but all comes ſhort of this, when they ſhall ſee him as he is in himſelf, ſee him face to face; as Friends talking together do look one another in the face, ſo ſhall Chriſt and godly Men ſee one anothers face.</p>
                  <p>There's a great difference between the ſight
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:52862:128"/> of a Picture (though it be a true Picture) of a dear Friend, when he is many hundred miles diſtant from us, and the ſight of his own face; far more bleſſed ſhall the Children of God be, when they ſhall ſee Chriſt as he is, then now they can diſcern him while they are in the body, and abſent from him, and can ſee him only by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations. If old <hi>Simeon,</hi> when he ſaw Chriſt as he was in his infancy, embraced him in his arms, and ſaid, <hi>Lord, now lettest thou thy Servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Luke 2.29. How then ſhall the ſight of him as he is, tranſport the Souls of the Saints with unſpeakable joy and admiration? if it were ſo delightful to ſee Chriſt in his infancy, in his ſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling cloathes, what joy will it be to ſee him in Heaven all glorious? if the fight of Chriſt in the types and promiſes, which were but prefigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of him, were ſo ſweet to the Saints of old, what will the ſight of Chriſt himſelf, the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type, be? <hi>Abraham</hi> foreſaw by the eye of faith, the firſt coming of Chriſt in the fleſh; <hi>he ſaw my day afar off</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and was glad,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Qui bona egerint, fulgebunt ſicut Sol cum Angelis in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam aeternam, cum Domino noſtro Jeſu Chriſto; videntes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ſemper, &amp; ab eo viſi, &amp; inceſſabili lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titia, quae apiſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient perfruentes. <hi>Damaſcen.</hi> lib. 4. de Fide.</note> John 8.56. Much more glad would he have been, with old <hi>Simeon,</hi> to have ſeen Chriſt himſelf: If <hi>John Baptist</hi> leaped in the Womb for joy, at the preſence of <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of our Lord, how will our hearts dance for joy, when we ſhall
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:52862:128"/> ſee the Lord Jeſus himſelf in his great Majeſty and glory? if it be ſweet to behold him in his Image, and in his People, who are but ſhadows of Chriſt; if ſometimes an heavenly viſion of Chriſt hath driven a man into an extaſie, and hath raviſhed him out of himſelf; Oh then what ſhall it be to ſee him as he is? if the inward ſight of him, by a few beams darted upon us by this glorious Son of righteouſneſs, doth transform us from glory to glory, Oh how will it then raviſh our hearts, when we ſhall have both an ocular and intellectual ſight of the Lord Jeſus?</p>
                  <p>Oh what running, thronging, and poſting was there to ſee Chriſt when he was upon earth, in his ſtate of abaſement? <hi>Zacheus</hi> being a man of a low ſtature, climbed up a Sycamore-tree, that he might ſee <hi>Jeſus</hi> paſſing by, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. what then will the ſight of <hi>Jeſus</hi> be, when you ſhall ſee the Son of man coming in power and great glory? when you ſhall ſee him with trumpets ſounding before him, and ſee him with his glorious train, with all his glorious Angels, as himſelf ſpeaks, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.27. to ſee him ſitting upon his Throne of Majeſty, and the World round about him; his Friends (the Sheep) on his right hand, the Goats (his Enemies) on his left hand: what a ſight will this be, eſpecially if you have then ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt, as to be placed among the Sheep at his right hand? how will it affect you, when he ſhall be always in your eye, and never out of your ſight?</p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:52862:129"/>
                  <p>If the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> was ſo ſtricken with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement when ſhe beheld the glory of <hi>Solomon, that there was no more ſpirit in her,</hi> 1 Kings 10.5. how will all the Saints be filled with admiration when they ſhall behold the glory of Chriſt? how did that aſtoniſhed Queen bleſs the Attendants of <hi>Solomon! Happy are thy Men, happy are theſe thy Servants that ſtand continually before thee, and hear thy wiſdom.</hi> Alas, what happineſs is this in regard of the Angels and Saints who ſtand conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in the preſence of Chriſt, in whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence there is fulneſs of joy, fulneſs of glory! was it ſuch an happineſs to hear the wiſdom of <hi>Solomon?</hi> what a tranſcendent happineſs is it then to hear the wiſdom of <hi>Christ,</hi> who is greater then <hi>Solomon?</hi> I conceive that the glory which three of Chriſt's Diſciples ſaw upon the holy Mount was but a glimpſe of that fulneſs of glory, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he is now ſilled in Heaven: yet that little drop was ſo affecting, that <hi>Peter</hi> cried out, <hi>Maſter, it is good for us to be here:</hi> He was ſo raviſhed with extraordinary joy conceived at the heavenly viſion, that he even loſt and forgat himſelf, and wiſt not what they ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.33, 34. but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overjoyed, it appears his wiſh was inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and his counſel raſh and unadviſed, (<hi>Let us build three Tabernacles, one for Thee, another for</hi> Moſes, <hi>another for</hi> Elias) for theſe Reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe he thought earthly Tabernacles fit habitations for heavenly Bodies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe he conceived not aright of the end
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:52862:129"/> of the viſion, <hi>viz.</hi> to comfort them; in letting them to ſee (as in a glaſs) what Chriſt's glory and their glory ſhould be; which he would have had continued, when it muſt of neceſſity be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted; for had Chriſt continued in this eſtate he could not have ſuffered, and ſo our ſalvation had not been accompliſhed. But while <hi>Peter</hi> was thus ſpeaking, behold a bright Cloud over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed them, and they feared when they were entering into the Cloud; had not this Cloud ſomewhat abated the glory of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition, it had not been poſſible for theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, in the ſtate of mortality, to have beheld the countenance of their Maſter. Now if Chriſt in his Transfiguration, while he was on Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> was ſo delightful to behold, when his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity appeared in a glorious form only but for a ſhort time, how pleaſant will the ſight of him be to the godly, when they ſhall ſee him by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect viſion, and enjoy him by full fruition? With abundant ſatisfaction ſhall the Saints behold the face of Chriſt in fulneſs of glory! Oh how will it raviſh their hearts, when they ſhall ſee him who gave himſelf for them? who loved them, and waſhed their ſins in his blood? who being the Prince and Captain of our ſalvation, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be perfected by ſufferings, that he might bring them into glory? when they ſhall ſee him who died for them, and roſe again for their ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification; aſcended up into Heaven, took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion thereof, and prepared a place for them,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:52862:130"/> and came again and took them to himſelf? they ſhall then be even tranſported with joy to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their Saviour, whom they loved ſo dearly all their lives, but never had the happineſs to ſee before; for whoſe appearance they longed, thirſted, ſighed, prayed, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus.</hi> Oh how will their hearts melt toward him (think you) when they ſhall ſee him! Oh this is he that died for me, that ſhed his precious blood for me: they will then look thorow him, if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and then to think they ſhall always ſee him and enjoy him, and never be divided from him any more, they will then be even raviſhed into an extaſie of joy; their ſight of him ſhall be <hi>laeta, familiaris, &amp; perpetua,</hi> joyful, familiar, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual; which is a ſpecial part of the beatitude peculiar to the Saints, from which the Wicked are excluded. Oh happy, yea thrice happy are thoſe eyes which ſhall ſee the face of Chriſt, whom they ſhall love perfectly, and of whom they are infinitely and eternally beloved! What a raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſight will it be to behold that Body, which was ſo foully disfigured upon the Croſs for our ſakes! It ſhall be undoubtedly (as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith) a thing full of all ſweetneſs and delight, when men ſhall there ſee and behold a Man, the Creator of men, and Lord of all things created.

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:52862:136"/> as it were the object of theſe ſinful luſts; they do in a peculiar manner defile the Body. What greater indecorum can there be for one that hopeth to have his Body glorified in Heaven, then thus to debaſe and vilifie it upon the Earth? Take heed likewiſe of intemperance in meats and drinks, of gluttony and drunkenneſs, for this alſo diſhonoureth the Body, takes away the heart, and makes it to ſtick faſt in the mire of ſenſuality, and makes a man a ſtranger to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly-mindedneſs; it ſets a man below a rational man, much more below a ſpiritual man, whoſe heart, whoſe hope, whoſe converſation is in Heaven.

               <p n="1">1. Before the Reſurrection, when the Soul ſhall remain ſeperated from the Body; of which I ſhall ſpeak ſomewhat briefly, becauſe among other wretched Doctrines hatched of old, and lately revived, this is found to be one, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Soul dieth or ſleepeth with the Body, and ſo abideth till the great day of the general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, when it ſhall be raiſed again with the Body: But two clear Scriptures may be oppoſed againſt this Opinion; the firſt is in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. where the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the priviledge which the Saints have while they are upon Earth, ſaid, they were come <hi>to the ſpirits of just men made perfect:</hi> not the Souls of any of the Saints living on the face of the Earth, for they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect: <hi>for we know in part, and prophecy in part; but when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part ſhall be done away.</hi> Hence then it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, that the ſpirits of juſt men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, muſt be no other then the Souls of the Saints ſeperated from the Body, and tranſlated unto
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:52862:138"/> glory: Now if the ſpirits of juſt men ſeperated from their Bodies are made perfect, they are not dead, for death is the deſtruction of perfection; the Body is never ſo imperfect as when it is dead; a diſeaſed Body is much more perfect then a dead Corpſe: ſo then if the Souls of the Saints were dead with their Bodies, they ſhould be ſo far from being made perfect, that they ſhould utterly loſe thoſe beginnings of perfection which they had while they were in the Body; their graces would be extinguiſhed, and there would be a loſs to them of that enjoyment of God, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, which they had here upon the Earth.</p>
               <p>The ſecond place of Scripture I ſhall produce againſt this Opinion of the Mortaliſts, is in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6, 7, 8. <hi>Therefore we are always confident, knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord; (for we walk by faith, not by ſight) we are confident, I ſay, and willing rather to be abſent from the Body, and to be preſent with the Lord.</hi> Here you may ſee, that while the Souls of the Saints are preſent in the Body, (as they are during this life) they are abſent from the Lord; albeit Jeſus Chriſt dwelleth in them by his Spirit, and they are ſpiritually united to him; yet in regard of local diſtance, they are abſent from Chriſt in reſpect of his Humane nature, not ſeeing him face to face; they walk by faith, not by ſight. Moreover, when their Souls are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and ſeperated from the Body by death,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:52862:138"/> they ſhall be preſent with the Lord; not walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by faith at a diſtance from Chriſt, but reſting in his preſence, immediately beholding him. The Souls of the Saints then do not die with the Body, but live in the preſence of their Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our at the very ſame time when they are abſent and ſeperated from the Body by death. This muſt needs be meant of the ſtate of the Soul, not after the reſurrection, but between death and the reſurrection, for that is the only time when the Soul is abſent from the Body; and during that time the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>it ſhall be preſent with the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To theſe may be added that gracious anſwer of Chriſt to the penitent Malefactor; <hi>Verily I ſay unto thee, this day ſhalt thou be with me in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,</hi> Luke 27.43. <hi>viz.</hi> the very ſame day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he died; Now the heavenly Paradiſe is no burying place for dead Souls, but a glorious ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation for the living ſpirits of juſt men made perfect. Obſerve likewiſe that argument of Chriſt, grounded upon the ſpeech of God to <hi>Moſes</hi> at the buſh, which ſtrongly proveth both the reſurrection of the Body, and the immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Soul, as well before as after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.31, 32. Have you not read what is ſpoken to you by God, ſaying, <hi>I am the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the God of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and the God of</hi> Jacob; <hi>God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</hi> This was ſpoken long after the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:52862:139"/> natural death of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> and ſo the Argument ſtandeth thus:
<q>Thoſe who have God for their God by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, are not dead but living; but <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> have God for their God by Covenant: <hi>Ergo</hi> they are not dead, but living.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So then they live in their principal parts, their Souls, while they are abſent from the Body, whereunto their Bodies are to be re-united at the great day, that their whole perſons may fully enjoy their God, and perfectly poſſeſs the fruit and benefit of God's covenant. <hi>verſe</hi> 34. this argument ſilenced the Sadduces. Finally, conſider what meant <hi>Stephen</hi>'s prayer at his death, <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my Spirit,</hi> or Soul, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.59. If his Spirit, or Soul, had died with his Body, why ſhould he call upon Chriſt more for the receiving his Soul, but becauſe he knew his Spirit, or Soul, was immortal, and muſt live and ſubſiſt when it was ſeperated from the Body? he prayed Chriſt to give preſent entertainment to his Soul, that he might reſt in the boſome of his love, until his Body ſhould be raiſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united to it. Now as this may ſtop the mouth of this lying Spirit, which of late is crept forth into the World again, ſo it may demonſtrate (according to the point in hand) that the Souls of the Faithful, after their ſeperation from the Body, are inſtated into bleſſedneſs. By which
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:52862:139"/> places fore-mentioned, and ſuch like, is refuted their Hereſie, who either directly deny the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul, or imply it as the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, who ſay, that <hi>Mori est penitus extingui,</hi>

                  <hi>&amp; reſurgere est ex non ente iterum exiſtere.</hi> And this Opinion ſome others have ſeemed to favour, in the Declaration of their Opinions about the Articles of Religion, in that they are altogether ſilent in the point that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the bleſſed reſt of the Saints Souls after this life.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> Of the bleſſedneſs of the Soul in general.</head>
               <p>MUch more might have been ſpoken of the bleſſedneſs of the Soul in glory, when it is abſent from the Body; but becauſe theſe things belong as well to the Soul re-united to the Body, when it hath full poſſeſſion of ſalvation, I chuſe to treat of them under that conſideration.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This ſhall be the wonderful felicity of the Soul, in that it ſhall have a Body every way ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to it ſelf, immortal, ſpiritual, incorruptible, glorious, as its habitation for a pure, immortal, glorious Spirit to dwell in; in this reſpect the glorified Souls now in Heaven (all the time of their ſeperation) do even vehemently deſire and
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:52862:140"/> wait for the redemption of their Bodies, who were their yoke-fellows in the day of their pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage upon Earth. Though the Soul of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever reign with Angels, yet hath ſhe a paſſion for her Body; and all the good ſhe doth poſſeſs, cannot take her from the deſire and memory thereof; though ſhe hath made trial of its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts, though this friendly Enemy hath often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times perſecuted her, and that ſhe hath deſired death to be freed from the tyranny thereof, yet doth ſhe languiſh as it were, and vehemently long after it. Though the Body be reduced to duſt, though it cauſe pity in its Enemies, and though it cauſe horror in thoſe to whom it was lovely, yet ſhe forbears not to deſire it, and to expect the reſurrection with a kind of impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that her Body may partake of the bliſs which ſhe enjoyeth. The Souls of the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted this life do not account their glory, their bleſſedneſs compleat, till their Bodies be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unted; hence they do naturally deſire their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union; and as they cry under the Altar, <hi>How long, Lord, how long will it be ere thou avenge our blood?</hi> ſo all the Souls of juſt men made perfect, with one voice cry out, How long, Lord, how long will it be ere thou redeem our Bodies, that we may be perfectly bleſſed in the full fruition of thy ſelf? Oh then how ſhall the glorified Soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in its glorified Body, raiſed from among worms, duſt and rottenneſs, reſcued from its captivity, from under the power of death and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:52862:140"/> and now again made one with the Soul, no longer to be a ſnare or burden to it, but a companion meet for it, taking in no object by the ſenſes that may in the leaſt degree endanger the polluting of the Soul, and having nothing in it that may ſtupifie the affections, or any way diſcompoſe the eternal reſt, diſturb the peace, eclipſe the joy of the Soul, interrupt its enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, or any way diminiſh its compleat happineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There ſhall be a perfect harmony between the Body with all its parts, and the Soul with all its powers; and both Soul and Body ſhall be fully conformed to Chriſt, and ſo ſhall moſt ſweetly comply each with other: and I conceive the very remembrance of that dulneſs, ſottiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, earthineſs, and droſſineſs, (which in the ſtate of mortality is in the Body) ſhall be matter of great joy to the Soul, now that it findeth ſuch a wonderful change in the Body transformed unto ſuch a glorious perfection; even as it is a great refreſhment to the mind of a man after a perfect cure to find the Body lightſome, full of ſpirits, and in perfect health after a lethargy, or ſome other dulling diſeaſe that hath debilitated nature, exhauſted the ſpirits, and indiſpoſed it for action.</p>
               <p>Then ſhall the happineſs of man be perfect, when a glorified Soul ſhall be united to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Body; and mutually communicating all their advantages, the Soul ſhall be happy in the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:52862:141"/> felicity of the Body, and the Body happy in that of the Soul; all their differences ſhall then be compoſed in this general peace: the Soul ſhall then forget all the revolts of the Body, nor ſhall the Body any more complain of the ſeverities of the Soul; but both of them remembring only the good they have done each other, they ſhall reign in Heaven in a community of glory.</p>

                  <p>LEt us now more diſtinctly conſider of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs of the Soul; firſt laying this general rule, that it ſhall be perfect: for the Apoſtle plainly ſheweth, that the Spirits of juſt men are made perfect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. Now the perfection of the Soul principally conſiſteth in the knowledg of God. Now there is <hi>Scientia directa &amp; intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiva,</hi> a direct knowledg of God upon view and ſight: Now this is either perfect, or imperfect.</p>
                  <p>A full and perfect knowledg of God himſelf, none hath but God himſelf; no creatures, no man, no Angel is capable of it; God himſelf
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:52862:141"/> fully and perfectly ſeeth himſelf, which no other can do; for a full and perfect knowledg of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Beeing is infinite, as that Beeing is. He that hath a full and perfect knowledg of any thing whatſoever it be, hath the full meaſure of that thing in his underſtanding, which he fully and perfectly knoweth. Now what is the ſhallow and narrow capacity of any created underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Man or Angel, that it ſhould meaſure the infinite eſſence and excellency of the God-head? it is not ſo much as a ſpoon to the Ocean; and there is leſs diſproportion between the water of the Sea, and the capacity of a ſpoon, then the underſtanding of Man or Angels, and the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite majeſty and excellency of God.</p>
                  <p>Now God knoweth himſelf fully and perfectly in himſelf. If the Sun-beams were animated, and living creatures endued with reaſon, how clearly and perfectly would they know and ſee through themſelves, every way being altogether light and tranſparent? God is the light of lights, a moſt pure, bright, and glorious Beeing; and he is of infinite wiſdom, and ſo fully and perfectly knoweth himſelf.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, there is a knowledg of God direct and intuitive, or upon view, which is not perfect, and this is of thoſe bleſſed Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures already poſſeſſed of glory: ſuch knowledg have the Angels, who ſee God face to face, as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.10. <hi>The Angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:52862:142"/> Heaven.</hi> They do not only ſee his back-parts, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, but his face, by an immediate view, beholding the beauty and glory of the Lord. Whether the Saints departed, before the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Body, do thus ſee the face of God, I determine not; doubtleſs they do already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a great degree of bleſſedneſs, the fruition whereof is more ſweet for one day, then the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying of all the World for a mans life: howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, after the reſurrection, when they ſhall be fully poſſeſſed of glory, they ſhall ſee the face of God as the Angels do, <hi>Job</hi> 19.25, 26, 27. <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he ſhall stand at the latter day upon the earth; and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my fleſh I ſhall ſee God; whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelf, and not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>David</hi> compareth the temporal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of Worldlings, which they enjoy in this life, with the bleſſed eſtate which he expected after the reſurrection of the Body; he calleth them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.14, 15. <hi>Men of the World, which have their portion in this life, and whoſe belly the Lord filleth with his hid treaſures; which are full of Children, and leave the rest of their ſubstance to their Babes.</hi> This was their ſeeming happineſs, all worldly and temporary. Now on the other ſide he ſpeaketh of his own condition: <hi>As for me, I will behold thy face in righteouſneſs; I ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, when I awake, with thy likeneſs.</hi> He cared not for thoſe hidden treaſures locked up in the mines and bowels of the earth, nor for a portion
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:52862:142"/> in this life, nor for large portions for his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but to behold the face of God in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; to ſee him face to face, (which he was aſſured of by faith) and ſo to be ſatisfied with his Image.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But why is this knowledg ſaid to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, ſith the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of this glorious condition of the Saints, ſaith, That then that which is perfect ſhall come, and that which is imperfect ſhall be done away?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer, this knowledg of God which the Angels have, and the Saints ſhall have in God himſelf, is</p>
                  <p>Perfect, in regard of the Subject in which it is.</p>
                  <p>Imperfect, in regard of the Object of whom it is.</p>
                  <p>Perfect in regard of the Subject, and that in two reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe it filleth the underſtanding, and ſatisfieth the ſpirit with a fulneſs of light reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from ſo glorious an object; ſo that the Soul hath a beatifical viſion of God, ſo far as it is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable. And as the eye is refreſhed by an object fitly proportioned, and hurt or dimmed by a diſproportionable eminency, or excellency, in the object ſurpaſſing its ſtrength and ability; ſo the Soul, perfected and glorified, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Spirits, have ſuch a knowledg of God in himſelf, as filleth them, not ſuch as confoundeth them; and this is perfect in regard of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſuch a perfection as they are capable of, and can contain.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="262" facs="tcp:52862:143"/>2. It is perfect in reſpect of the ſubject in which it is, in that it is as much as is due and requiſite to make their happineſs compleat and perfect without any defect; it is ſo perfect, that they need no more knowledg of God then that which they have: and who can deny but that this is a perfection of knowledg in reſpect of the ſubjects? they are as bleſſed every way, and ſo eſpecially in regard of the knowledg of God, as ſuch crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures can be; and that is a perfection, though relative, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (as they ſay) in relation to the ſubjects in whom it is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, on the other ſide, this knowledg which theſe glorified ſpirits have, and ſhall have of God in himſelf, is imperfect in reſpect of the Object of whom it is, <hi>viz.</hi> God, whom they know in himſelf; that is, it is not a knowledg matchable to the infinite eſſence and excellency of the God-head: This cannot be comprehended by any of the creatures.</p>
                  <p>Yet let me tell you, the underſtanding ſhall then be more perfect,
<list>
                        <item>In its apprehenſion,</item>

                  <p n="1">I. In its apprehenſion; that ſhall be moſt quick and acute; the Soul ſhall have a moſt ſharp and piercing eye-ſight, readily apprehending and conceiving; it ſhall not ſee thorow a glaſs, it ſhall not have its knowledg at ſecond hand.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It ſhall not apprehend God by the Creature, by the light of Nature; the Creatures are the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:52862:143"/> darkeſt repreſentations of God, there are but ſome of his foot-prints in the Creatures, they are no glaſſes wherein we ſhall behold the face of God: At the beſt, the Creatures are but <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Ladder to us, by which we may aſcend from Earth to the knowledg of God in Heaven; the Creatures can but take us by the hand and lead us to God, and lift up our minds to Heaven; the ſight of God is more then all the Creatures can afford, becauſe God's face cannot be ſeen in the Creature: and yet this we may grant, that the Saints ſhall ſee God in the Creatures then, but with this difference, as <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> well obſerveth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dionyſ.</hi> Ercop.</note> the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures will be <hi>ſpecula clara in ſtatu integro,</hi> clear glaſſes in a perfect ſtate; but now <hi>in ſtatu corrupto,</hi> in a corrupt ſtate they be <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula aenigmatica,</hi> obſcure glaſſes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The glorified Soul ſhall apprehend God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another manner then now it can know him from his Word, or underſtand him in his Word. The knowledg of the Word is by the Schools called <hi>cognitio Fidei,</hi> the knowledg of Faith; it is a far greater knowledg then the knowledg of God from the Creatures; Faith is of an higher reach then Reaſon, or the light of Nature; the Word of God ſpeaks of God more, then the eye of Reaſon ever can by the eye of Nature kenne; things which Reaſon could almoſt deny, (at leaſt diſpute againſt) the Word reveals of God. The Creatures ſhew but the foot-ſteps of God,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:52862:144"/> the Word ſheweth his back-parts, his glorious attributes, his gracious goodneſs: but yet the Word cannot ſhew us the face of God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Beatifick Viſion is more then the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God we have from the Word.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The knowledg of God in Heaven is more then that which the Saints have of him by the light of grace in this life; by the light of grace the Saints do behold the light of God's counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in this life: <hi>David</hi> often prays, Lord, lift up the light of thy countenance upon us; but yet the light of grace cannot ſhew the very counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God himſelf, it muſt be the light of glory that muſt diſcover that to us. Indeed to know God by the light of grace, (which more properly is termed the knowledg of Faith) is called life eternal, <hi>John</hi> 17.3. It is called eternal life, becauſe to believe in God, and in Chriſt, is the <hi>medium,</hi> a way and means to life eternal; and then again, it is <hi>vita eterna inchoata,</hi> ſaving Faith in Chriſt is the beginning of eternal life: but the eye of Faith is too weak to look God in the face: yet this we may grant, that what the Creature, what the Word reveals of God, what we know by the light of grace, we ſhall have a more clear, more full, and more manifeſt ſight of it in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall then ſee God <hi>as he is, (i.)</hi> know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by himſelf; we ſhall know him by himſelf without the Creature, know him by himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the external preaching of the Word, know
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:52862:144"/> him without the Sacraments; the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments being glaſſes wherein we behold the glory of God, but in Heaven there ſhall be no need of theſe glaſſes, we ſhall ſee his face without theſe glaſſes by himſelf. Look as God doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt himſelf to the Angels, ſo he will manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to us; they ſee God in himſelf, and by himſelf, therefore they are ſaid <hi>always to behold the face of God,</hi> and ſo ſhall glorified Saints do.</p>
                  <p>Here the bodily eye may be dim, either by reaſon of the weakneſs of the eye, a defect of ſtrength in the organ or inſtrument of ſight, or becauſe of ſcales or films growing over it; ſo it is with the underſtanding, or eye of the Soul, its ſight may be dim and imperfect, either by reaſon of its natural weakneſs, or by the ſcales of luſts or ſinful corruptions overgrowing it; theſe do exceedingly blind the underſtanding, and dull the apprehenſion, while we are in this ſtate of mortality: Now both theſe ſhall be done away in that ſtate of glory; the organ, or eye of the Soul, ſhall then be ſtrengthned with perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, there ſhall be no weakneſs remaining in it, it ſhall be moſt ſtrong and vigorous; the Soul ſhall then be elevated and raiſed to that ſtrength, that it ſhall be able to gaze upon the glory of God for ever, and ſo ſee him, as never to loſe the ſight of him: then likewiſe all the ſcales ſhall be removed, there ſhall not be the leaſt mote of luſt to dim the eye of the Soul, it ſhall ſee clearly and perfectly; and ignorance, which is
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:52862:145"/> here a brand of ſin, ſhall be quite defaced by the brightneſs that ſhall enlighten the Soul. <hi>Tunc nec falli, nec peccare poſſunt homines, veritate illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati, &amp; in bono confirmati;</hi> then men illightened with the truth, and confirmed in good, can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deceive, nor be deceived, nor ſin, ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How quick was <hi>Adam</hi>'s apprehenſion in the ſtate of innocence? how did the acuteneſs of his underſtanding penetrate into the inſides of the Creatures, as is manifeſt by his giving them names ſuitable to their natures? Now as Chriſt (the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi>) is incomparably more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and Believers are the ſpiritual ſeed of Chriſt, as Men and Women are the natural ſeed of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo far more tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſhall that perfection of apprehenſion and underſtanding be, which Chriſt ſhall illighten the Souls of his Saints withal (as his ſeed) in that ſtate of bleſſedneſs, even far ſurpaſſing that which <hi>Adam</hi> had, and which ſhould have been propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated from him to his natural iſſue, had he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevered in the integrity of his nature wherein he was created.</p>

                  <p n="2">II. AS the apprehenſions, ſo likewiſe the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Saints ſhall be perfected in Heaven: Here ſometimes quick apprehenſions
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:52862:145"/> are accompanied with ſhallow judgments, as on the other ſide ſolid judgments are joyned with ſlow apprehenſions; but in glory, the ſoundneſs of the judgment ſhall be correſpondent with the clearneſs and quickneſs of the apprehenſion, it ſhall not be ſubject to the leaſt miſtake, nor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to any error; here we are full of levity, and wavering in matters of Religion, taking up opinions lightly, without due examination; and for want of ſtrength of judgment, we are ready upon every ſleight occaſion to receive another Doctrine; and likewiſe preſuming upon the ſtrength of and ſubtilty of our own wits, not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by grace, we are ſhamefully foiled. Love and affection to our own vain opinions, is a great impediment to ſound judgment; it breeds pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice againſt the truth, making men reſolute in defending their opinions, if by any way of wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture to their purpoſe it be poſſible. But in Heaven the ſoundneſs of the Saints judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall be anſwerable to the acuteneſs of their apprehenſions, they ſhall be no longer accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with doubts and darkneſs; as they learn without labour, ſo they ſhall not fear forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, drawing light and wiſdom from the very fountain; they ſhall know all things in their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; their Souls ſhall then be penetrated by the Spirit of God, and their judgments clarified with the light of glory; the Saints ſhall then be able not only to view the ſuperficies, or ſurface of things, but alſo to dive into the bottom of them,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:52862:146"/> to comprehend the breadth and length, the height and depth of them; they ſhall then ſee that God is ever like himſelf, and that all things in him do moſt exactly conſent and agree together.<note place="margin">Sicut terra reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctu coeli eſt inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis quantitatis, ſic honitas aliarum ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiarum reſpectu Scipturarum. <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand.</hi>

If <hi>John Baptist</hi> (according to our Saviour's teſtimony) were greater then any of the Prophets, becauſe he ſaw Chriſt already come in the fleſh, whereas they only foreſaw Chriſt to come; and yet the leaſt in the Kingdom of God (that is, in the

                     <hi>SECT. I.</hi> A deſcription of what things ſhall be ſeen in God by the Saints in Heaven.</head>
                  <p>HE that ſeeth a wiſe and mighty man, although he ſeeth his out-ſide, yet his in-ſide he ſeeth not, <hi>viz.</hi> the beauty and perfections of his mind; but in Heaven the Saints ſhall ſee the Divine beauty and excellency with the eye of the inner man; they ſhall ſee the brightneſs of his glory and majeſty; they ſhall behold him, not by a
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:52862:147"/> reflex, as a man may ſee the image of the Sun in a Looking-glaſs, but they ſhall as it were look upon him in a direct line.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They ſhall with admiration behold him as the firſt eternal Being, as the Ancient of days, comprehending all the Centuries of years, all the ages and generations, all the hundreds and thouſands of years, all the changes and periods of times, all of them making up but a moment, and being no more then the twinckling of an eye to his eternity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They ſhall ſee him as he is in himſelf, that he is glorious in himſelf, in his being; that he is infinitely glorious in all his Attributes; that he is eternally glorious in all his works; they ſhall ſee him to be ſuch a God as he proclaimed himſelf to be, that he is the Lord God, the Lord God of Gods; they ſhall know the immenſity of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the infiniteneſs of his greatneſs; that he is infinite in grace, infinite in mercy, infinite in glory; they ſhall then ſee the unlimitedneſs of his eſſence, filling them with himſelf, with his preſence and fulneſs filling all things, and with his infinite being encloſing all things that are.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They ſhall clearly ſee him as an unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able God, who hath wrought all the wonderful changes that have hapned in the Heavens, in the Earth, in the Seas, yet that himſelf hath remained ſtill immutable; they ſhall look upon him as the firſt univerſal mover, who ſetteth all things in
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:52862:147"/> motion, in whom and by whom all things move, himſelf remaining immovable.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They ſhall not only be convinced of his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power, but ſhall ſee it clearly, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly diſcern his infinite ſtrength; it is one thing to read of the great ſtrength of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and to believe it as a certain truth; it had been another thing, and a matter of far greater ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, to have ſeen him ſmiting the Philiſtines hip and thigh with a great ſlaughter, killing a thouſand of God's Enemies with the Jaw-bone of an Aſs, carrying away the gates and poſts of a City upon his ſhoulders, pulling down with his hands the houſe wherein thouſands of the Philiſtines were ſitting: ſo it is one thing to read and believe the Almighty power of God, but another thing, and a matter of greater ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Soul, to have a clear view of it; to ſee God forming Heaven and Earth of nothing, and changing times and ſeaſons; to ſee him raiſing ſome out of the duſt, and lifting them out of the dunghil, and ſetting them with Princes, and throwing down the mighty from their ſeats, that were exalted to places of great eminency and dignity, overturning Nations and Kingdoms, and working great wonders. Theſe things (though paſt) it is conceived, they ſhall be as clearly ſeen in God, when we ſhall ſee him face to face, as if they were but then in doing. With great delight alſo ſhall they ſee his Almighty power, that ſhall bring up all the Potentates of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:52862:148"/> the Earth, all men, high and low, rich and poor, young and old, before his tribunal; in tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlating all his Children into everlaſting glory, and throwing the Wicked into everlaſting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. They ſhall alſo ſee God exerciſing his power in diſſolving the frame of this viſible World, rolling the Heavens together as a ſcroll, and folding them up as a garment; melting the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements with fervent heat, and burning up the Earth with the works that are therein. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, they ſhall ſee what God ſhall do for ever, they ſhall ſee God in all his workings to eternity: What a raviſhing thing would it have been,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Burr.</hi> in Beatitud.</note> if any of us ſhould have been admitted into the preſence of God, and there to have ſeen what God hath done from the beginning of the World to this day? but when this World ſhall be at an end (as it will ſhortly be) God and his Saints will then remain everlaſtingly, and they ſhall be for ever with the Lord, and they ſhall be there where they ſhall ſee what God will do for ever.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They ſhall ſee the infinite love of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite God, of which now they have but a taſte; they ſhall then clearly underſtand that love of God, which is the ſpring of all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly things, out of which they were ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to holineſs, eternal life and glory; that love out of which Chriſt himſelf (as a Mediator and Redeemer) iſſued, and out of which all things were given them that appertain to life,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:52862:148"/> and godlineſs; that love which prevented them in their loſt condition, which turned the eye of God's compaſſion towards them when they lay in their blood; that love which iſſued out a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of all their ſins from the Court of mercy, which lengthened out the patience of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them when they lingred in their ſins. Then ſhall they know fully where this love was bred, and that none but the eternal love and delight of the Father could have outed ſo much love; then ſhall they ſee themſelves over head and ears drown'd in many obligations to his infinite love.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They ſhall ſee him as the Fountain of light and wiſdom, as the only wiſe God, as the Father of lights, in whoſe light themſelves ſee light, from whoſe face all thoſe beams do ſhine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their Souls are filled with heavenly wiſdom; they ſhall ſee clearly that God is light, filling Heaven with his brightneſs and glory, and fixing the eyes of all the Angels and Saints upon him, as an object infinite, altogether lightſome and lovely. They ſhall behold that infinite wiſdom of God which created Heaven and Earth, which great piece of workmanſhip had nothing but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for its <hi>materia,</hi> how all the different parts whereof it is compoſed had the ſame original, and how this <hi>vacuum,</hi> by the word of God, brought forth the Heavens with their Conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Earth with all its Fields, the Sea with all its Rocks; how the Heavens and Earth were
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:52862:149"/> created in an inſtant, though there went ſix days to their diſpoſal. The Saints in Heaven ſhall alſo underſtand that wiſdom of God which in all ages hath governed the World, and directed all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to their courſes and motions; how this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable work hath endured numberleſs ages, contrary to the Laws of Nature, which ſuffereth that ſoon to periſh which ſhe is not long in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Then ſhall the myſteries of Providence be fully opened, and we ſhall ſee the Births in the Womb of Providence, which on Earth are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible to us; then ſhall we underſtand all the ways, circuits, lines, turnings of Providence, and ſee how Chriſt hath ſteered the helm of Heaven and Earth when means have failed, and men and times have changed. They ſhall likewiſe know that wiſdom that hath ordered the ſins of Men and Devils to holy ends, never intended by the Actors, which hath over-reached the craftieſt devices of the Serpent and his Seed— They ſhall likewiſe behold that manifold wiſdom of God, that contrived the whole method of mans Redemption and Salvation, the very Maſter-piece of Divine wiſdom; that wiſdom that hath given light to the blind, wiſdom to the fooliſh, and abundance of light to thoſe that ſate in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in the ſhadow of death, and which made thoſe that were darkneſs to become light in the Lord. This ſhall be matter of admiration to Men and Angels, that the great God ſhould condeſcend to look on ſuch vile Sinners, ſo far
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:52862:149"/> below the free love and majeſty of the moſt High. Then ſhall the Saints underſtand all the counſels of God concerning themſelves from all eternity; when they ſhall be admitted into the Houſe of God, they ſhall not only ſee what God himſelf is, but they ſhall ſee his heart, his will, and all his ways, and glorious contrivances for their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. They ſhall ſee him as that God who is truth it ſelf; they ſhall exactly diſcern how every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of his, every propheſie delivered by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to the Churches, and recorded in his word, is fully accompliſhed, not one failing or falling to the ground; and that whatſoever God promiſed, or bound himſelf by covenant to perform, though it ſeemed difficult, or long, before it was fulfilled, yet it came to paſs at laſt in its appointed time: Oh the ſweet ſatisfaction which the Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhall find in the full contemplation of the truth of God every way manifeſted, and ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly verified in and upon themſelves, in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by his power unto ſalvation, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving them to his heavenly Kingdom, in guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by his counſel, and bringing them to glory; when they ſhall ſee that all the art, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, ſkill and power of Men and Devils, could never fruſtrate nor make void the leaſt tittle of God's ſacred truth.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. They ſhall ſee him as a God infinite in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, of perfect purity; they ſhall with great delight look directly into that overflowing foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:52862:150"/> of holineſs, which hath ſtreamed into ſo many thouſand Souls, which hath waſhed ſo many unclean hearts from their filthineſs, which filleth all the Saints and Angels in Heaven with perfect holineſs; then ſhall they behold thoſe fair hands (as I may ſpeak) that ſtooped to waſh ſuch black-skinned and defiled Sinners, and purged away the filth of the Daughter of <hi>Sion</hi>— If the <hi>Egyptians</hi> for many ages have had a great deſire to find out the fountain of that River <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> which by his yearly inundations watereth the Land in that hot climate, (having no ſhowres of rain) and maketh it abundantly fruitful: Oh then how ſhall glorified Souls rejoyce to be brought to the Spring-head of holineſs, which hath watered ſo many barren Souls, and made them bring forth the fruits of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. They ſhall clearly ſee him as an all-ſufficient God; they ſhall ſee that rich treaſury opened, out of which all that good was given, which was received by any, or all the Creatures in Heaven and Earth. The Lord by many notable inſtances of his own glorious works, <hi>Job</hi> 38.22. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced <hi>Job</hi> of ignorance, and poſed him by a multitude of interrogations; among the reſt ſaith he, <hi>Hast thou entered into the treaſures of ſnow? or hast thou ſeen the treaſures of hail?</hi> But in that ſtate of glory, not only this holy man, but every one of the Saints ſhall be admitted to view the treaſures of God's all-ſufficiency, out of which all good things concerning this life and the life
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:52862:150"/> to come, have been and ſhall be diſpenſed and diſtributed among the Creatures, life, breath, all things, grace and glory; grace of juſtification, grace of ſanctification, preventing grace, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent grace, exciting grace, confirming grace, ſtrength againſt temptation, ſupport under af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, help in extremities, relief againſt ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impoſſibilities, faith, repentance, love, hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they ſhall ſee the Spring of that River of God's pleaſures, and of thoſe living Waters, which have refreſhed ſo many thirſty Souls when they ſeemed ready to periſh. Oh how would it tickle the vain curioſity of many men, to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the ſight of the rich treaſures of great Princes, and to have their Cabinets (filled with the rareſt and moſt ſumptuous Jewels) unlocked before their eyes? Alas, they are not ſo much as common ſtones of the ſtreet, in compariſon of the treaſures of God's all-ſufficiency which the Saints ſhall behold in Heaven.</p>

                  <p>FUrthermore, as the Saints in Heaven ſhall ſee what God is in himſelf, ſo they ſhall perfectly and fully ſee what God is to themſelves; here is the happineſs of the beatifical viſion, not only to know that God is infinitely gracious in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but that he is alſo infinitely gracious to us; not only to know that God is goodneſs it ſelf, <hi>bonum ſummum,</hi> the chiefeſt good, but alſo to
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:52862:151"/> know God is our chiefeſt good, our happineſs. Then the Saints will all ſay to God as <hi>Job</hi> did, when he had that familiar conference with God, <hi>Job</hi> 42.5. <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye ſeeth thee.</hi> So when we come to Heaven, every one of us will ſay, Lord, I have heard thy Miniſters ſay, that thou art a merciful, a gracious God; I have heard thy Word to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim thee to be a Lord, a Lord God gracious and merciful, a God pardoning ſin, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving iniquity, and now mine eyes ſee thee; now I plainly ſee that thou art ſuch a God as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed thou art. I tell you this is one main part of the beatifical Viſion, not only to ſee what God is in himſelf, but to ſee clearly what a good God he is to us; this is the happineſs of all the Saints, this is the fulneſs of joy which is in the preſence of God, this is the rivers of pleaſure which are at God's right hand. Suppoſe the Devils and damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Spirits ſhould know what God is in himſelf, that he is the God of grace, the God of mercy, the God of glory, alas, they would but little bleſs themſelves in the knowledg of God, becauſe God is not thus to them; it is their woe of woes, becauſe they know that God is to them a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire, devouring burnings, and an angry Judge: To know a thing, and not to poſſeſs that thing, is no happineſs at all; to know there are riches in the bottom of the Sea, doth nothing rejoyce a man, but to poſſeſs thoſe riches; to know there are rich treaſures of all good things,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:52862:151"/> and not to have any part in that treaſure, what comfort hath a poor man in the knowledg of that? It is true what <hi>Chryſologus</hi> ſaith of the rich Man in Hell,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>The glory of</hi> Lazarus <hi>doth more torment him, then the fire of Hell.</hi> It is no comfort to him to ſee Heaven, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſome, and himſelf to be thruſt into Hell. This brings joy to the heart of man, when he knows a thing, and ſeeth it to be his own. There are three things that make a man glad: 1. When a man hath that which he loveth. 2. When that which he hath and loveth is the beſt thing. 3. When a man knoweth that he hath, and that he loveth, is the beſt thing. All theſe things are in the beatifical Viſion.</p>
                  <p>The Saints enjoy that which they love, <hi>viz.</hi> God; then God is the beſt thing: among all the treaſures of good things, nothing to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to God. Likewiſe the Saints do know that they do enjoy God, that God is their God; and what God is in himſelf, that he is to them: this is that which will ſatisfie all the Saints when they ſhall awake out of the duſt.</p>
                  <p>They alſo ſhall ſee all things in God: it is a true Theorem among the Schools, <hi>Videntes Deum omnia vident in ipſo;</hi> thoſe that ſee God, ſhall ſee all other things in him. And the reaſon that they give is this, becauſe the Divine eſſence is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:52862:152"/> object of all things. <hi>Fulgentius</hi> makes this compariſon,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Now this knowledg will not be a comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive knowledg of God; we may be ſtudying God to all eternity, and yet we ſhall never be able to comprehend him: God is infinite, and our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings are finite; it is impoſſible for an infinite object, to be confined within the limits of a finite being. <hi>Aquinas</hi> gives this good rule;<note place="margin">Divina eſſentia to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta videtur, quia eſt ſimpliciſſima partibus carens, ſed non to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliter. <hi>Aquinas.</hi>

The glory which Chriſt will put on his Saints ſhall be exceeding great, and exceeding ſtrange, beyond all conceit and imagination; the heart of man cannot now perceive it; but when the eye ſhall ſee this glory, and the heart ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, Chriſt will be wonderfully admired in them and by them. The glory of his power will be admired, in that ſuch poor duſt and aſhes ſhould be advanced to ſuch an height of glory, that he can make his Creatures ſo glorious. They will admire his love toward them in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating ſuch glory to them; they will admire his grace in bringing ſuch worthleſs Creatures to ſuch glory, even from the Dunghil to the higheſt Throne of glory. Moreover, they ſhall clearly underſtand that great myſtery of the Trinity, of the Perſons in the unity of one God-head and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:52862:154"/> Divine eſſence, which is now ſo far above the underſtanding of the ſincereſt Chriſtian; they ſhall ſee how the Son is begotten of the Father, as the word and wiſdom of the Father, and abideth in the Father; how the Holy Ghoſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from both, and abideth in both; they ſhall ſee how theſe three are diſtinguiſhed by a perſonal propriety, ſo that they are three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſubſiſting in themſelves, and yet together in number are one eſſence, or ſimple Deity, one power, one wiſdom, one goodneſs, one majeſty, one immenſity, one eternity; then ſhall they ſee how the Father is in the Son, how the Son is in the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt in both; how all are in each, and each in all.

The Apoſtle was at a ſtand, as one whoſe ſtature in that condition of mortality was too low to wade any further into that great deep; therefore he cries out, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>How unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!</hi> The waters are too deep, I can find no bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; <hi>for who hath known the mind of the Lord, or been his Counſellor?</hi> But in Heaven the Saints ſhall fully underſtand this unſearchable depth, <hi>viz.</hi> how God ſhould ſo carry on the great deſigns of the declaration of his pardoning mercy to ſome, and his puniſhing juſtice to others; and that in both theſe God was free in his grace, and juſt in his judgments, though he neither choſe nor called according to works; that the damned Creature was moſt guilty, and that God was both ſevere and graciouſly merciful, and that none hath cauſe to complain of God; and that the fundamental cauſe of this various adminiſtration with Nations and Perſons, is the holy and ſoveraign will of
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:52862:155"/> God, who hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth. This is the depth without a bottom that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of. But in Heaven the Saints ſhall be filled with the knowledg of theſe myſteries, the boſome of God being opened to their underſtandings.

               <p>MOreover, the Saints ſhall ſee and know that innumerable company of Angels, their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, each of their perſons in particular. As the Angels know every Elect perſon, becauſe it is their work to gather the Elect from all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Earth, and to ſeperate them from the wicked, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.41. ſo the glorified Saints ſhall know the holy Angels, whom the Lord ſent forth to miniſter for them, whom the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for their guard while they were upon Earth, who encamped round about them while they were encompaſſed with ſo many dangers. Some Divines are of opinion, that the number of the Angels is ſo great, that they exceed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compariſon all corporal and material things in the Earth; and like as the greatneſs of the Heavens exceedeth the greatneſs of the Earth without any proportion, even ſo doth the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the glorious Spirits, exceed the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of all corporal and material things that are in the World, with the like advantage and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. Now what thing can be imagined more wonderful then this? Again, if every one of the Angels (yea though it be the leaſt Angel among them all) be more beautiful and goodly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold then all this viſible World; what a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſight ſhall it be then to ſee ſuch a number of beautiful Angels, to ſee the perfections and

Oh what honour is this which God will do to his Children hereafter, when he ſhall exalt them to ſo high a dignity, as to place them among the Angels in Heaven, and make them like unto the Angels of God?</p>

                  <p>As we think it reaſonable to conclude the Soul to be immortal, becauſe it deſireth to be ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be enflamed by any ſtudied notions and apprehenſions of eternity; ſo with equal proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, we may prefigure and delineate ſome parts or ſhadows of our future happineſs, being guided by thoſe innate and univerſal propenſions which encline every Soul to deſire and wiſh the ſame thing. Among thoſe tranſcendent deſires which iſſue from our natures, this is one, that thoſe acquaintances which were virtuouſly begun on
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:52862:157"/> Earth, may be renewed and perfected in Heaven. This deſire was once of ſo great authority, that former ages had reſpect unto it; for when they found it eaſier to overcome all other terrors of death, then that one of an everlaſting abſence from a Friend, they were careful to chear a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting Soul, by aſſuring it, that the happineſs of the other World, next to the contemplation of the Divine nature, conſiſted in the gaining of new, and the indiſſoluble recovery of old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. What they made a part of their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, we admit but as an appendix to ours; and as we think it not ſafe to joyn any Creature unto God, to make up the object of our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo we believe it would derogate from the glory of his goodneſs, if particular Souls, like ſo many divided channels, ſhould have their own banks full, but yet be debarred from all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and mutual knowledg of each others bleſſedneſs.</p>
                  <p>Our Creed moreover calls upon us to believe a communion of Saints; which if it be a matter of our faith here, it muſt be an object of our knowledg hereafter; if we muſt believe that there are ſome who ſincerely communicate with us in the faith in this life, then we ſhall hereafter clearly know who were our fellow-members in that communion; and as faith it ſelf ſhall be done away by evidence, ſo ſhall that communion which is here by faith, be hereafter perfected by that communion which ſhall be by viſion.</p>
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:52862:158"/>
                  <p>Thoſe who have laboured to find out the moſt intimate and peculiar properties of the humane nature, do affirm, that it was made and faſhioned for Society. Now as Divines uſe to ſay, That Chriſt came not to aboliſh, but to perfect the Law; ſo may we pronounce of our bleſſedneſs in Heaven, that it ſhall not extinguiſh, but eſtabliſh, confirm and perfect thoſe deſires which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the Soul, as reaſonable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal. If the Soul may carry with it a ſociable inclination, then may it for the uſe and exerciſe of this deſire be admitted to the knowledg of other Souls, and of thoſe eſpecially with whom it had ſojourned on Earth, that like fellow-travellers, who have been equally afflicted with the difficulties of the way, they may thenceforth interchangeably communicate their joys, ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from their preſent reſt and peace.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But it may be ſaid, that in our union unto God ſhall be ſupplied all imaginable contents; and that the Souls of the bleſſed ſhall be held in ſo great admiration, as that they cannot admit the mixture of any ſecond or leſs joy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> Though this opinion ſeem ſpecious, and agreeable to reaſon, yet we muſt conſider, that as in the Divine nature we admit no uſeleſs At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, (ſuch as the Divine juſtice and mercy would be, if there were not a Creature to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe them on) ſo likewiſe in the Humane, we muſt either ſay it hath no aptneſs eternally to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire or rejoyce in the good of another, (which a
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:52862:158"/> ſociable nature inwardly abhorreth) or elſe we muſt allow it an object whereon to practice its endleſs love and joy. This love we conceive ſhall be the perfection of that deſire which was begun on Earth, but always mixt with fear and jealouſie (being ſubject to thoſe common infirmities, which attend both the powers &amp; acts of the Soul in this life) and this joy we believe ſhall ſucceed in the place of that condolency and compaſſion, which on Earth we ſuſtained one for another. This love therefore, and this joy, muſt have ſuch an object, as was once the ſubject of our fear and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, which cannot be either God or Angels, but a Creature only, of the ſame nature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with us. Theſe are perhaps but wild and ranging conceits, which aſſert that there is no nature, but it is capable of happineſs; no happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without ſociety, no ſociety without a plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of individuals of the ſame kind. Yet by the power of theſe imaginations, did that Diſputer in <hi>Plutarch</hi> create a plurality of Worlds for ſociety ſake; and by them was <hi>Hortenſius</hi> in <hi>Tully</hi> puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zelled, and made to doubt, how God may be ſaid to be bleſſed, if alone. And I think that thoſe rude and untaught ages, meaſuring the bleſſedneſs of God by what themſelves moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in, did eaſily admit a multitude of gods to prevent a ſolitude, which in their belief over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth all happineſs. Though theſe opinions reliſh of the blindneſs of the age that brought them forth; yet as the darkeſt Bodies by colliſion
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:52862:159"/> may ſend forth ſome light, ſo out of theſe aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſome ſparks and glimmerings of truth may be produced; for though in God there be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite fulneſs to ſatisfie an infinite deſire, and ſo he alone may ſuffice to make himſelf happy, yet is he pleaſed not ſo preciſely to love himſelf, as not alſo to be delighted with the bleſſedneſs of his Creature: and if God (who is eſſentially bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and hath all bleſſedneſs in himſelf) be not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding by his own goodneſs, enclined to delight in the glory of a poor Creature, it muſt needs be, that Man, who is the image of this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hath imprinted and ſtamped upon his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a proneneſs to delight in the bleſſedneſs of his fellow-creature, as well as a deſire to ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf happy.</p>

                     <hi>Sol.</hi> This fear, I think, will vaniſh, ſo ſoon as we conſider, that it is the ſame beauty which we behold in God, and love in the Creature, though
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:52862:159"/> of a different ſplendor; and as the Stars, the Air and Water, by their borrowed lights do raiſe us to behold the Sun, the fountain of all that light; ſo whereſoever the rayes of glory are caſt, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on Angels or Men) we cannot but behold God ſhining on each nature, and confeſs him to be all in all. Moreover, it is not a glance, but a fixing on the Creature (which in that ſtate is not to be feared) can endanger our happineſs, otherwiſe neither God nor Angels are truly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; for the Divinity of former ages would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us, that God as it were cometh daily out of himſelf to behold his own image in the Angels, and the Angels look upon the ſame reſemblance as caſt from them, and reflected by the Soul; but neither God nor Angels are ſo raviſhed with thoſe dimmer beauties, as to dwell upon them, but do ſuddenly return back to the Fountain, God to himſelf, and the Angels unto God.</p>
                  <p>But to let paſs theſe excuſable conjectures, let us remember upon what ground we are ſolicited to believe, how the Angels are daily converſant about us in acts of knowledg and love in their miniſterial employments, in fulfilling the Divine juſtice &amp; mercy; yet notwithſtanding theſe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing interruptions of their viſion, they continue bleſſed. And we believe alſo that Chriſt himſelf (though in perfect glory) continueth his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us, which being an act of mediation between divers parties, cannot be performed without a knowledg and love of thoſe for whom
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:52862:160"/> he interceedeth. And though it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that in God there can be no intermiſſion in the contemplation of himſelf, becauſe by the ſame ſingle act, he at once beholdeth himſelf, and all things elſe; yet we muſt not imagine ſuch an infinite comprehenſiveneſs in the creature, as to be able within the ſame Act to involve and circumſcribe all that may be known or deſired in every object, for this were to extol the Creature above it ſelf, making it equal with God. The Angels therefore, and Chriſt himſelf as man, have their actions bounded; and thoſe acts by which they immediately behold and love the Creature, are not the ſame by which they immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template, and neceſſarily love the Creator. Wherefore I think we may without raſhneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that our bleſſedneſs, which is a cleer and everlaſting contemplation of the Godhead, may conſiſt with ſuch inferiour acts in the ſoul, as are requiſite to conſtitute a bleſſed ſociety among the Saints.</p>

                  <p>IT was no ſmall contentment and ſatisfaction to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that he ſhould meet his beloved <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> in the preſence of Chriſt: for thus much ſeemeth to be intimated by that his exult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demand: <hi>What is our hope, or joy, or Crown of rejoycing, are not ye even in the preſence of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt at his coming?</hi> And the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:52862:160"/> ſame Apoſtle, when he would ſet bounds and limits to a Chriſtians ſorrowing for the dead, tells us, that we muſt not ſorrow, as thoſe that have no hope (ſuch as are all that are imbued with thoſe <hi>Epicurean</hi> principles of the Soul's Mortality, and it's reſolution into nothing) ſuch mens ſorrow finds no caſe, becauſe that good whoſe abſence they bemoan, in their opinion is irrecoverably loſt: and to ſhake hands with a dying friend, is with them as much as to bid them everlaſtingly farewel: But a Chriſtian's tears (like drops from a cloud) may ſometimes fall; they muſt not, like a River, be alwayes running. He may ſorrow becauſe he is parted from ſome good (ſuppoſe from a loving friend) bur this ſorrow muſt be tempered with this hope, that he ſhall ſee his friend again, and that good which as yet continues the object of his ſorrow (while conſidered as ſtoln and taken from him) muſt after a while become the ſubject of his hope and comfort, being put in mind, that God who for a time laid it out of his ſight, will reſtore it back again unto him. This the Apoſtle allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be his meaning, by bidding us, comfort one another with theſe words: for if otherwiſe, it would fully anſwer the Apoſtle's meaning, to ſay it is enough, that God raiſe thoſe that ſleep to glory, though he exile them from a mutual knowledge of each other. Then let us ſee what comfort this interpretation can afford to a penſive and lamenting Soul, which may ſuggeſt unto it
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:52862:161"/> ſelf on this wiſe; God will reſtore my friend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf, but not to me; he will bring back the Jewel into the Cabinet, but will lock it up from my ſight; he vvill reſtore the thing, but not repair my loſs: and it ſeemeth all one to me to loſe him in an eternal nothing, and not to be allowed to know that he is a glorious ſomthing; now what comfort can we place in ſuch a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation?</p>
                  <p>This perſwaſion of a reſtauration to a mutual knowledge of each other, containeth alſo ſome advantages and motives to a Godly life; for the fear of being eternally divided from thoſe I ſincerely love on earth, will draw me to an imitation of their ſanctity, if herein they be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary: or give me the courage to lead them into the way, if their courſe be irregular and exorbitant: for thoſe who unfeignedly deſire to meet at the journeys end, will ſtudy to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve each other in the way: and they who would wear the ſame crown of rejoycing in the preſence of Chriſt, will aſſiſt each other here, that they periſh not in the agony and conflict: it gives an edge and ſharpneſs to thoſe affections which are employed for each others good, when we conſider that that heat and fervency, which they ſpent in deſire and travel for one another, ſhall be turn'd into an exceſs and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of delight in each other.</p>

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:52862:161"/> through all the parts of time; being guided by an opinion, that ſo long as the body continued undiſſolved, the ſoul would not forſake the earth, but continue hovering about the place where the bodies lay: in like manner the Souls of men, which by many kinds of aſſociation may be united into one maſſe and heap, and as it were become parts of one another, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the more vigilant and active for each others everlaſting welfare, ſo long as they are perſwaded againſt an eternal divorce and diſſolution, and do contrarily believe they ſhall be rewarded by a ſenſe of each others happineſs; and that that union which is among themſelves (as of one member to another) ſhall not be diſſolved, but perfected by that union which ſhall unite them to Chriſt as to their Head, and through him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.</p>

               <p>IN the next place I will ſhew how the wills and affections of glorified Saints ſhall be raiſed to a fulneſs of glorious perfection: now it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, God muſt be firſt gloriouſly united to the Soul and her powers, before ſhe can by her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding ſee, and by her will and affections
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:52862:162"/> love and embrace God: in Heaven God ſhall be immediately united to the very nature of the Soul her ſelf, which is chief in man, yea formally man, which can be no otherwiſe done than by a glorious change and immutation made in the Soul it ſelf, by communicating to her by grace, a glorious and perfect eſtate of participated eternity, which is the root and foundation of all that moſt glorious exerciſe about which the Saints in Heaven are converſant.</p>
               <p>This being ſo; the wills and affections of glorified Saints ſhall be perfectly pure and holy, without the leaſt tincture of defilement; they ſhall be holy as God is holy; not infinitely holy, but perfectly holy, without mixture of any thing contrary to holineſs: their wills ſhall ſuit and meet exactly in every thing, with the pure and holy will of God; they ſhall will what he willeth, and nothing but what he willeth; their wills ſhall give full conſent to the will of God in all things: There ſhall be compleat holineſs in the will: our wills (like to the will of Chriſt) ſhall be altogether conformable to the will of God; we ſhall fulfil the will of God: the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of our wills to God, is the glory of our wills, which in this life are like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Image, partly clay, partly gold; here we are partly regenerate, partly unregenerate, but in Heaven we ſhall be all gold, all holy: glorified Saints ſhall never find any grudgings of their old diſeaſes (ſin and corruption in them) in the

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:52862:163"/> is that is propounded, ſo much the more ſtrongly doth it draw the affection to it, eſpecially if it be cleerly diſcerned. But God is a good of infinite excellency, containing all things which the Saints can deſire, and is cleerly diſcerned by them, therefore he moſt ſtrongly draws their affections to himſelf. They ſhall in Heaven ſee ſo much excellency in God, and be ſo fill'd with his love, that their hearts ſhall be full of holy flames of love toward him: there ſhall be nothing either within them or without them to draw away their love from God, or leſſen or cool their affections toward him: all things that they ſhall ſee or hear, or underſtand, ſhall ſerve to fill them with his love, and keep up and confirm their love in the height of it for ever: they ſhall be ſo fully like to God, that it ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them not to love him perfectly: God ſhall dwell in them, and they ſhall wholly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs him; and they ſhall dwell in God, and he ſhall wholly poſſeſs them: they ſhall be knit to each other in mutual love to all eternity. The principal employment of the Saints in Heaven is to love God; and all the vertues in Heaven are uſeleſs, except charity, and enjoyment, which is the reſt of love, and is alſo its recompence, ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine;</hi> for as deſires do diſquiet lovers, when they poſſeſs not what they long for, ſo being now in the poſſeſſion of him whom they love, they are ſatisfied.</p>

                  <p>The love of the Saints in Heaven is much perfecter than ours upon the earth: whatever pains we take to love God on earth, our love is never without ſome notable defect to enfeeble it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Here our love is alſo divided, becauſe ſelf-love is not yet extinguiſhed; and the greateſt Saints, if they mannage not their intentions well, do rob God of all the love wherewith they indulge themſelves. In brief! it is almoſt ever intereſted: we love not God ſo purely, as not to ſeek our own pleaſure with it, when we ſeek his glory; and we are more earneſt with God for riches and honours than for heavenly graces: but the Saints in glory have not one of theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections in their love; their love is not blind, becauſe they love him whom they ſee; and the brightneſs of glory that illuminates them, is a ray diſpelling all the darkneſs of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings: it languiſheth not as ours doth, nor ſpends it ſelf in its longings, becauſe they poſſeſs what they love, and being intimately united to God, are eternally inſeparable from him: their love is not divided, becauſe ſelf-love enters not into the celeſtial <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but is quenched by the flames of true charity; finally it is not

AS the Saints ſhall love God entirely, ſo they ſhall love each other in the Lord: they ſhall ſee the Image of God ſhining cleerly and gloriouſly in each other, and ſo ſhall love God in each other, and each other in God: <hi>Peter</hi> ſhall admire Chriſt in the glory conferred on <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ſhall admire Chriſt in the glory conferred on <hi>Peter:</hi> The Saints ſhall find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves all agreeing in God; and ſo among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they ſhall ſee nothing in any of their brethren, but what ſhall be moſt lovely, nothing to eſtrange their hearts, or damp their affections: they ſhall not be capable of any touch of envy, for every one of them ſhall be full of glory and bleſſedneſs: And albeit ſome have higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of glory than others, yet this cauſeth no emulation or jealouſie among them. The variety of the world (as one obſerveth) is one of its rareſt ornaments; the flowers which checker a walk, do embelliſh it: the Stars which make an hundred ſeveral figures in the firmament, do ſet a luſtre upon its beauty; neither doth any thing make a Countrey more pleaſant, than the diverſity of the parts that compoſe it: the riches and glory of a ſtate dependeth upon its diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity:

Great men are apt to be proud, and to deſpiſe their inferiours: Men of low degree are envious, and murmure at thoſe that are above them. But in Heaven the difference of degrees produceth their beauty, and giveth no occaſion of envy or jealouſie; the Crowns of glorified Saints are proportionable to their labours and ſufferings for Chriſt. <hi>They that turn many to righteouſneſs ſhall ſhine as the Sun,</hi> Dan. 12.

Every one is glad of anothers happineſs; and without intereſting in any one, they find that the felicity of particulars contributeth to that of the publique.

                  <p>OUt of love floweth joy, which openeth and enlargeth the heart upon the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God and Glory: the beatifick joy is as ſublime, ſupernatural and wonderful, as the beatiſick Viſion of God, and Love it ſelf is; for theſe are altogether equal and commenſurate among themſelves, as well by intenſive perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as by eminency of nature or ſpecifical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: ſo much do the Saints love as they ſee, and ſo much do they rejoyce as they love. The chief object which delighteth the Saints is of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodneſs, beauty and ſweetneſs, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending in it ſelf the goodneſs, beauty and ſweetneſs of all things: and this joy of the Saints doth ſo far ſurpaſs all worldly joys, which are taken in, either by the ſenſe or underſtanding, as the Viſion of God in Heaven doth excell all the knowledge we have here upon earth, and as much as an infinite good doth exceed a finite good: for that joy is infinitely greater and ſweeter than all the joyes of this life. <hi>I ſay infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely,</hi> ſo that although all the joyes of the world, and all the delights of the ſenſes (which may be had in this life) ſhould be gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one, and ſhould be augmented never
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:52862:166"/> ſo much, yet could they never be equalled with the joyes of glorified Saints, becauſe this joy is of an higher kind, <hi>viz.</hi> Divine, and the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it is of a far other nature than the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of earthly joyes. This will the more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear, if we conſider the eminency, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, and ſtability of the good things in which the Saints in glory do rejoyce.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, and above all things they do rejoyce in the intrinſecal good things of God, which are infinitely abundant in him, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they ſee him to be of infinite power wiſdom and goodneſs, they ſee him to be eternal and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible, they ſee him to be the Author of all things, the end of all things, the preſerver of all things: they ſee all good, ſweetneſs and bleſſedneſs moſt abundantly contained in him; and their joy is the greater, becauſe they ſee him poſſeſs all theſe things after a moſt eminent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; for as they love God incomparably more than themſelves, ſo do they rejoyce more in thoſe eminencies that are in him, than in all their own bleſſedneſs. If the joyes that the Saints have here in this vale of tears be many times unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and far greater than all worldly joyes, how incomparably greater then ſhall their joy be, when it ſhall be ſaid to every faithful Soul, <hi>Enter thou into thy Maſters joy,</hi> Math. 25.

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:52862:169"/> bleſſed communion of the Saints: and as the Soul ſhall aſſume the hand, the eye, and every member of the body unto a participation of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, without ſoliciting them again to undergo the fore-paſt drudgeries in the fleſh; ſo the Father and the Child, and one Friend may behold ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without the intimation of ſuch duties, or any reſultance of ſuch mortal deſires as are implied in thoſe relations.</p>
                  <p>But as the Soul is permitted to reſume its own body, rather than another, and reaſon exacts it ſhould gratifie that fleſh, whoſe inmate it had been, rather than another: ſo likewiſe thoſe perſons whom ſome nearer relations had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united, may be conceived to retain ſo much partiality, in the diſpenſation of their joy, as in the firſt place to rejoyce, that they are again united in the participation of glory, excluding none from being an argument of their joy, but preferring ſome in the order of their rejoycing: but it may be that this affection muſt comply with the juſtice of the divine bounty, and that we ſhall there beſtow a greater meaſure of our joy, where he hath been pleaſed to confer a greater portion of his glory. It would ſeem unreaſonable that the Soul alone ſhould inherit that glory which was procured perhaps by the torments and ſufferings of the body, as in holy Confeſſors and Martyrs; and the ſame reaſon which makes the Soul and Body ſharers of the ſame happineſs, begets a mutual claim among the Saints to each
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:52862:169"/> others joy; for one man may be a powerful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of another's bleſſedneſs; the Father's care may preſerve the Child, and the piety of the Son may enflame the Father; the Mothers tears may reduce the perverted Son, the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Husband may ſave the unbelieving Wife; and one Friend may with happy ſucceſs, inſtruct, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh, rebuke, and pray for another. Now is it more reaſonable to think that theſe immortal benefits and obligations ſhall be promiſcuouſly and undiſcernably ſwallowed up in the Sea of glory, or to ſay that theſe parties whom it may concern, ſhall ſee each other face to face; ſome gratefully rejoycing that the Inſtruments of their Salvation, like Stars of a greater magnitude are more eminently glorious: others alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in beholding their labours ſo highly bleſs'd, as to have procured the endleſs bliſs of their fellow-creatures. Our Saviour tells us, what joy there ſhall be for the converſion of a Sinner, in the preſence of the Angels, who by reaſon of their nature are ſtrangers to us: if Angels, who are in the preſence of God, and but of a remote alliance to us, be as it were turned aſide from the contemplation of the chiefeſt good, to behold with joy a repenting Sinner, ſhall not men who are of the ſame ſtock and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neage, be much more allowed ſome expreſſions of joy (ſuitable to the greatneſs of the wonder) when they behold one another, no longer repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinners, but glorious Saints.</p>

To conclude! the frame of their bodies and ſpirits, the place of their abode, their company, the objects which they ſhall ſee and hear, all things within them and without them ſhall concur to make their joy compleat, and to cauſe their hearts to reſt in everlaſting peace.</p>

                  <p>Holy <hi>David</hi> having here taſted of God's ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, cries out, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee, there is none upon earth that I deſire beſides thee?</hi> Pſal. 73.25. intimating to us, that he that hath God, hath enough in God: The Soul that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth God in this life, hath recovered that great loſs that fell upon <hi>Adam,</hi> and all Man-kind by fin: Man by ſin loſt God, now he that hath God in Chriſt, hath recovered this great loſs: Man in his firſt eſtate had enough by enjoying God; now he that recovereth this loſs, wanteth nothing, for he findeth enough in God. And although <hi>Adam</hi> in innocence enjoyed many other things beſides God, as perfect health, poſſeſſion
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:52862:171"/> of the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> and full authority over the Creatures, and albeit theſe things were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable in a degree in their kind, yet man's hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in that ſtate did not conſiſt in poſſeſſing theſe things, but in enjoying God: and all the glory and ſweetneſs, and any thing that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable in all theſe things, was derived meerly and wholly from God. Now whatever God doth here give to man by the Creature, he will ſupply in Heaven without the Creature, <hi>viz.</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by himſelf: if the ſtreams be ſweet, how much better is water in the Spring, and purer there? In Heaven the Saints ſhall want nothing, yet ſhall they enjoy nothing there but God; he will be all to them, their drink, their food, their reſt, their joy, their pleaſure, the height of all their honour, he will be all, and more than all unto them.

                  <p>ANd as for the affections of fear and ſorrow, and anger, they ſhall have no place in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: for then they ſhall be ſet far above the fear of all evil; the Saints being poſſeſſed of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite good, which is God himſelf, for their portion, they ſhall have no cauſe then to fear any evil; there is no evil can hurt them, for no evil ſhall be able to reach them that are in poſſeſſion of him that is an infinite good: they are alſo poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of God (the infinite good) in perpetuity; they have him in everlaſting poſſeſſion: for otherwiſe, although they need not fear any evil while they are poſſeſſed of him, yet they might fear the loſs of him, and their woful ſeparation from him, and then they ſhould lye open to all
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:52862:172"/> ſorts of evils; therefore to prevent this fear, the Lord hath betrothed them to himſelf for ever, and hath given himſelf to them in Marriage, and that in an everlaſting covenant, and will never be divorced from them, but be theirs for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p>The graces of Repentance, Mortification, Self-denial ſhall have no place in Heaven, which are of great uſe here in the way to Heaven: there ſhall be no ſenſe of evil to be ſorrowed for, nor ſin to be repented of, nothing diſtaſteful to provoke their anger, or to diſcompoſe thoſe bleſſed Spirits that are above; there ſhall be a perfect harmony between God and them.</p>
                  <p>Neither ſhall there be any uſe of thoſe graces of Faith and Hope in Heaven. S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Now abideth faith, hope, and charity, theſe three, but the greateſt of theſe is charity:</hi> why greater than the other, but becauſe this abideth immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal for ever? In Heaven inſtead of believing we ſhall ſee; here the object of faith is things not ſeen; the thing promiſed, but not yet performed; now in the life to come, when all things that are promiſed are fully performed to us, and poſſeſſed by us, there is no uſe of faith, in relation to theſe things. —So for Hope, when all the glory of Heaven is fully enjoyed, that the Saints hope for, there is an end of Hope in reference to the ſame things: the affection of Hope ceaſeth not, until the good that is deſired and hoped for, be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and made preſent; but that good thing
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:52862:172"/> being had and attained unto, then the affection of Hope ceaſeth, for what we have and enjoy we hope not for,<note place="margin">Viſibile non eſt objectum Spei.</note> 
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.24, 25. Therefore, ſaith <hi>Auguſt.</hi> Hope is a Child of Faith, by which man hopeth (from him whom he knoweth) for that which yet he hath not: Now when the good that we hoped for is obtained, Hope doth end and ceaſe. Yet notwithſtanding, although Faith, Hope, and Patience, ſhall ceaſe in reſpect of their objects, yet they are eternal in reſpect of their fruits, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.12. The Apoſtle ſtirring up the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to walk after the examples of thoſe that are now in glory, ſpeaks thus; <hi>Be ye followers of them who through faith and patience have inherited the promiſes.</hi> Thoſe things that heretofore were not ſeen by them but by an eye of Faith, they are now in full poſſeſſion of, they do inherit the promiſes: on the other ſide, they have no more ſufferings to endure, therefore there is no more uſe of patience; but the fruit of thoſe graces which they ſought for, that they now inherit and enjoy. S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. that <hi>he that ſoweth to the Spirit ſhall reap life everlaſting.</hi> When the Husbandman ſoweth his ſeed in the Earth, the ſeed dieth, and is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in the ground, there it lies hid, he ſees no more ſeed till the harveſt cometh, but then he reapeth many Buſhels for one: ſo he that ſoweth to the ſpirit, worketh in the ſtrength of thoſe graces, ſhall reap life everlaſting: he
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:52862:173"/> ſhall have no uſe of thoſe graces in the life to come, but reap the fruit of it, even life eternal: when the Saints come to poſſeſs Heaven as a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion caſt out by God's own lot for them from all eternity, they ſhall for ever enjoy the fruit of their piety, and the end of their Faith and Hope: Oh how ſweet ſhall the remembrance of their work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of Hope be to all eternity?</p>

               <p>HAving ſpoken of the Circumſtances and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the glory of the Saints in Heaven, in the next place I ſhall treat of the adjuncts thereof.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The glorious ſtate of the Sons of God is a ſtate of liberty, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21. I will ſhew in what reſpects it is a ſtate of liberty.</p>
               <p n="1">I. A liberty from all ſubjection, Natural, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, Magiſtratical; in this ſtate of liberty all yokes ſhall be broken to pieces; Fathers ſhall no more exerciſe their paternal authority, and Sons ſhall not be under their command; men ſhall be no more ſervants to men, the higheſt Potentates ſhall no more exerciſe authority over men: as it is ſaid of Marriage, <hi>They ſhall neither marry nor be given in marriage;</hi> ſo I may ſay of ſubjection,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:52862:173"/> they ſhall neither command nor obey in the reſurrection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24. <hi>He ſhall put down all rule, and all authority and power.</hi> Chriſt will put down all the authority which Fathers have over their Children, which Maſters have over their Servants, which Princes have over their Subjects and Vaſſals, all the authority which both the Enemies and Perſecutors have over the Church; then it ſhall have no more nurſing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Mothers; all Crowns and Scepters ſhall be caſt down at the feet of Chriſt, he will put them down, the Greek word is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vabit,</hi> he will at the laſt day put them down, not onely that they ſhall not prevail, but that they ſhall be utterly aboliſhed.</p>
               <p n="2">II. They ſhall be delivered even from that ſweet and gracious ſubjection to Chriſt as King and Mediator; Chriſt ſhall rule over his body, not as Mediator, but as God; he himſelf will lay down the Crown of his Mediatorſhip, and deliver up his whole government into the hands of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24, 28. <hi>And when all things ſhall be ſubdued unto him, then</hi> &amp;c. When Chriſt hath levelled all authority with the ground, and ſhall have trodden down all his Enemies, then he will rule no more as Mediator, but give up the Kingdom to God the Father, and God will be all in all, he will immediately govern all his Saints.</p>
               <p n="3">III. A liberty from all ſpiritual Tyranny in divers reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:52862:174"/>1. It is a liberty from the Tyranny of Sin: Sin though it doth not rule in the Godly as a King, yet as a Tyrant: though the Saints do not, and never will ſell themſelves to work evil, yet while they are in this body they are ſold un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſin: no ſlavery is more intollerable to a Holy man, than this ſlavery to ſin; it is a Godly man's hell to be under the Tyrannical power of any luſt: Slavery to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is liberty, compared to ſlavery to pride, to worldly-mindedneſs, or to any luſt whatſoever. It was the doom of a Godly Martyr to have a dead man chained to him, his eyes to the dead man's eyes, his breaſt to the dead man's breaſt, that he might periſh by the ſtench of the dead Carcaſs. Such is a Godly man's preſent condition to be tyed to the body of ſin, which is a very death to him in whom is the life of grace. Now the ſtate of glory will ſet all the Children of God at liberty from this thraldome: ſin will then be put off, when glory is put on: when the new man is perfectly renewed in reſpect of degrees and parts, the old man which is corrupt according to deceitful luſts, ſhall be perfectly deſtroyed in reſpect of preſence and operation: in the ſtate of glory they will not be afraid of ſinning, ſuch will their liberty be from ſin; they ſhall be as free from all ſin as the Sun from the leaſt ſhadow.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a ſtate of liberty from all tokens, effects, yea fears of the wrath and diſpleaſure of God: Now and then God writes bitter things againſt
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:52862:174"/> his people in this life, and makes them his mark, to ſhoot the arrows of his diſpleaſure into their very Conſciences. What doleful complaints have the Godly made, and ſtill do make of God's dealings with them? ſome of them live in Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to the fear of God's wrath all the dayes of their lives: Now there is no liberty from the fears of God's diſpleaſure in this life, ſo long as there is the remnant of ſins within them; while we have a body of ſin within us, we ſhall have a miſerable body: now in the ſtate of glory they ſhall enjoy a perfect liberty from wrath, and all their chains of fears ſhall be knockt off; the glorified ſhall no more fear wrath, than the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified ſhall hope for favour; they ſhall no more dread Hell, than the damned truly deſire Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; their perfect ſenſe of God's love toward them, and their perfect love of God will caſt out all theſe fears: the ſtate of glory is a fearleſs eſtate; as far above fear as Heaven above earth; the mountain of glory cannot be removed with the greateſt tempeſt of the fears of any evil.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a ſtate of freedom from all afflictions: now afflictions are compared in Scripture to Bonds, Fetters, Chains, Yokes, and ſuch En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines and Inſtruments of miſerable bondage. The evil of ſin and afflictions are twins born together, and ſhall ceaſe and dye together: when the Soul takes her flight to the mountain of glory, ſhe caſteth off the mantle of ſuffering: Glory and miſery are as inconſiſtent together, as the moſt
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:52862:175"/> contrarious extreams; ſooner ſhall Eaſt and Weſt meet in one point, noon and midnight in one moment, than perfection and glory, and the leaſt affliction; <hi>Lazarus</hi> is now as great a ſtranger to afflictions, as <hi>Dives</hi> to pleaſures.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is a freedom from all temptations and rage of Satan, it is impoſſible for the Devil to tempt a man in glory. When man was in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtate of grace, he tempted him to ſin; but when man is in a perfect ſtate of glory, he cannot tempt him; the Devils are caſt out of Heaven, never to appear there to tempt any who have made their entrance into it: the Church hath a promiſe that Satan ſhall be bound up a thouſand years; but then he is bound to eternity: the Devils are now in chains of utter darkneſs, but through God's permiſſion, Satan's chain is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lengthened; but then no more lengthening: now he walketh up and down aſſaying to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and ſeeking whom he may devour, but then he ſhall walk no longer; the Saints ſhall follow the Lamb whereſoever he goeth, and ſhall not in all their walks meet with a Devil to tempt them to any ſin whatſoever.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The ſtate of glory is liberty from death, from the fears of it, and from all things tending to mortality; bondage to death will be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up of this life of liberty; glory is trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant over Death, Hell and the Grave, bidding defiance to them: O Grave where art thou! O Hell where art thou! O Death where art thou!
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:52862:175"/> 1 Cor. 15.54, 55. <hi>Death and Hell were cast into the lake of fire,</hi> Rev. 20.14. By Hell (there) we muſt underſtand the Grave: Death and the Grave ſhall be damned as well as the wicked.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſtate of glory is a liberty from the rage, wrath, and perſecution of all the wicked men in the world: their rage and perſecution is a bondage and captivity to the Saints, hindring them from ſerving God with deſired freedom: they cannot put forth their godlineſs, but they expoſe themſelves to the ſcoffs, hatred, rage, and perſecutions of the world; now the ſtate of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will put a great gulf between the Godly and the Wicked, which will hinder them from all intercourſe: for know, that if the damned could again be in company, or in the place where the godly are, they would perſecute them again to the uttermoſt, though they know they muſt be damned, and therefore the Devils now hate and tempt them, though they aggravate their own torments.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is a liberty from all imperfections of graces, and weakneſs in their ſerving God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From all imperfections of their graces, which in this preſent life are very imperfect: <hi>we know but in part,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: ſo we believe but in part, we love God but in part, we are Holy but in part, we are zealous for God but in part: there is more doubts and ignorance than know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:52862:176"/> more unbelief than faith, more want of love than love, there is more ſin than grace and holineſs: now the ſtate of glory is a ſtate of perfection; <hi>we ſhall know as we are known,</hi> our underſtandings will be enlarged, that we ſhall know God fully and perfectly, our faith will be turned into ſight, our hope into poſſeſſion: we ſhall then love God with all our hearts, with all our ſouls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Angels are called Seraphims, becauſe (as ſome ſay) they burn in love and zeal toward God; ſo ſhall all the Saints be filled with this Seraphical love, we ſhall be as holy as our natures are capable. The Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God in this life are compared to the Moon, becauſe of thoſe ſpots in her, which are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; but in the ſtate of glory they are com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pared to the Sun which hath no ſpots in it; and as the Prophet ſpeaks of the Sun and Moon, that the light of the Sun ſhall be ſeven-fold more re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſplendent than now: ſo the graces, the holineſs of the Saints ſhall be ſeven-fold more holy than now they are.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It ſhall be a liberty from all weakneſſes and infirmities in ſerving God, this is the neceſſary conſequent of the former; for the more glorious and holy a man is, the more able he is to ſerve God, if perfectly ſanctified; then he ſerveth God perfectly: the Angels fulfil the whole will of God, becauſe they are filled with grace; they run, yea, they fly in the wayes of his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: this liberty and enlargement ſhall all the
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:52862:176"/> Saints have in the ſtate of glory: while they are here, they are in bondage to much ſpiritual deadneſs, and ſlothfulneſs, they pray, they praiſe God acceptably, though they cannot pray nor praiſe him perfectly; they may pray and purpoſe to run the wayes of God's Commandements, but cannot becauſe they are too weak, and are fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with ſpiritual ſlothfulneſs and deadneſs: glory will do away all this, and make us as ready and able to do the whole will of God, as Angels do.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It is a liberty from all natural clogs which the body in this ſtate of union faſtens upon the ſoul, inſomuch that the body is <hi>animae ergaſtulum,</hi> the priſon of the ſoul; it is <hi>pondus,</hi> or <hi>onus animae,</hi> the burden or weight of the ſoul; the regenerate ſoul cannot act vigorouſly, becauſe the body is ſo unweildy; the ſpirit is willing, but the fleſh is weak: but when the ſoul and body ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united, and meet in a ſtate of glory, the body will be a nimble handmaid, and pliable to all the motions and commands of the ſoul: the body then (which is now the ſouls priſon) will be the ſouls paradiſe: and both ſoul and body will act moſt vigorouſly; the ſoul will never tyre out the body, nor will the body clog the ſoul; they will both be unwearied in their glorious ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; the body then will be ſpiritual, though not a ſpirit, and become immortal, incorruptible, as the ſoul is.</p>
               <p n="9">9. It is a liberty from many duties and ſervices, and
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:52862:177"/> ſpiritual exerciſes, which are now required of us; the Saints work ſhall be leſſened in Heaven. The Service of the Church and people of God under the Goſpel, is much leſs than it was under the Law: hence the ſtate of the Church under the pedagogy of the Law is by the Apoſtle called <hi>a ſtate of bondage,</hi> a ſtate of ſubjection, but the ſtate of the Church under the Goſpel is called <hi>a ſtate of liberty:</hi> but when the Church ſhall be taken up into glory, then their ſervices ſhall be far leſs than now they are; many duties and graces ſhall be done away in Heaven; we ſhall pray no more for any mercy for our ſelves; all praying ſhall be turned into praiſing of God; we ſhall not hear the Word, nor receive the Sacraments any more; nor faſt and afflict our ſouls any more; we ſhall no longer mourn for ſin; repentance will be done away, yea faith it ſelf (as many Divines conceive) ſhall be done away: Pray we ſhall not, becauſe then we ſhall never be in want: our ſouls ſhall be ſo abundantly ſatisfied with the fulneſs of God's houſe: we ſhall mourn and repent no more, becauſe we ſhall ſin no more. Our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the ſtate of glory will be taken up in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God, in admiring God, in loving God, rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in God, giving him praiſe and glory for the riches of his grace toward us in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="10">10. In reſpect of the place, it is a ſtate of liberty indeed: the vaſt Heaven of Heavens, O ye Saints, ſhall be the place of your habitation and delight: what is the whole world compared
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:52862:177"/> to it, it is but a narrow priſon, an houſe of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, an houſe of bondage to a gracious ſpirit, it is but as a Cage to a bird, ſo is the world to the ſoul of a Godly man.</p>
               <p n="11">11. It is a liberty from all fears or dangers of everloſing their glory and bleſſedneſs, which then they ſhall enjoy; they ſhall never be afraid of loſing God, Chriſt, Heaven, Happineſs, but ſhall be ſecured to all eternity, which is the Crown of this glorious liberty of the Children of God. It is a ſore thraldome to be perplexed with fears of loſing our enjoyments, it imbittereth all our joyes, it is death to a worldling to think he muſt die, and leave all his riches, honours, friends, delights; much more will it be a very Hell to the afflicted, if they ſhould be afflicted with the fears of loſing Heaven: but no ſuch fears or thoughts ſhall at any time (during eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity) perplex the hearts of the Godly, it caſteth out all ſuch fears: they ſhall ſee it is impoſſible for them to loſe what they do poſſeſs. Notable is that phraſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.26. <hi>Between us and you there is a great gulf fixed:</hi> that if the glorified would get out of Heaven, they cannot come to the damned; and the damned cannot come out of Hell to Heaven; God hath faſt bolted the gates of Heaven and Hell with an everlaſting decree.</p>

               <p>Queſt. <hi>Here it may be demanded, how the bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Saints is made perpetual, endleſs, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting?</hi> Adam <hi>was made perfect, after the Image of God, perfectly bleſſed, perfectly holy, and yet he fell both from holineſs and happineſs: this bleſſed estate of his ſeemed to have been of very ſhort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance; yea, many of the Angels, which were more excellent and glorious than man, and had none to tempt them, yet left their habitation, and fell from this bleſſed estate; how then cometh it to paſs that the happineſs of man ſhall be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="333" facs="tcp:52862:178"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> For anſwer hereunto, if <hi>I</hi> ſhould ſay, that they ſhall ſee God face to face, and ſo ſhall be filled with God, and ſo all occaſions of ſin, and revolting from God ſhall be prevented; and they ſhall be ſo abundantly ſatisfied in God, and ſo invincibly ſtrengthened and confirmed by God dwelling in them, that nothing ſhall ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail over them, as in the leaſt degree to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw their affections from God. I ſee not how this might ſuffice: for doubtleſs the Angels that kept not their firſt eſtate, did thus ſee and enjoy God, yet they fell totally and finally. — There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſole reaſon is the will of Almighty God, his infinite goodneſs, his eternal love toward them, according to which he hath made a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace with them in his Son, by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and oath, aſſuring them of eternal life: and this immutable will and love of God declared in the infallible truth of his gracious promiſe and covenant, is a better and firmer aſſurance than the higheſt perfections and excellencies, that any meer creature is capable of: yea a child of God here on earth, having the leaſt meaſure of true grace mixt with many corruptions, almoſt ſtifled with the body of death, oppoſed, diſcouraged, diſcountenanced by a wicked and ungodly world, aſſaulted by all the powers of darkneſs, and with numberleſs temptations, is in a ſafer condition for perſeverance, and is better aſſured to hold out to eternal life, becauſe of the verity of God's promiſe, and the firmneſs of his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:52862:179"/> grounded upon the rock Chriſt-Jeſus, than one that were by creation perfectly upright and happy, if his holineſs and happineſs were only in his own keeping, and not eſtabliſhed upon this everlaſting foundation, the will of God, and the infallibility of his promiſe. This being the cauſe, we may alſo conceive divers holy ends, for which as he doth preſerve every child of his by his effectual working power unto ſalvation, ſo having brought them thither, he will for ever preſerve them in his Heavenly Kingdom. As,</p>
               <p n="1">I. That he may have ſome of the loſt ſeed of <hi>Adam</hi> to be everlaſting Monuments of his rich grace, who to all eternity ſhall be real demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of his infinite love, and unſpeakable mercy and goodneſs, in redeeming, juſtifying, ſanctifying, cleanſing, and preſerving them.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That he may be to eternity praiſed for his glorious victories over all his enemies, that when the Devil and his Angels have uſed the utmoſt of their craft, might and malice, when the hands of the world have been hot and ſmoking with the blood of the Saints, and their hearts ſick with blaſphemy and malice againſt Chriſt and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, when ſin hath thrown out its moſt deadly poyſon, or when death hath been devouring Man-kind ſo many ages, yet ſhall the Almighty power of God be ſo prevalent over all, as to make, and everlaſtingly to keep his elect in a bleſſed ſtate; and he in them, and they with him ſhall ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate an eternal and moſt glorious triumph in the Kingdom of Heaven,</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:52862:179"/>III. That Jeſus Chriſt may be eternally ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured as a Redeemer: God the Father will have the fruit of his Son's purchaſe to be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and everlaſting; he will magnifie the infinite value of that price which Chriſt hath paid, the infinite vertue of that blood which Chriſt ſhed for the redemption of loſt ſouls, by eſtabliſhing his ranſomed ones in everlaſting happineſs: therefore it is ſaid, <hi>He ſhall come to be glorified in his Saints, and admired in all them that do believe,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.10. Chriſt is now very admirable and glorious in the hearts of his redeemed ones, who are illightened with ſaving knowledge, who have an experimental taſte in themſelves of the efficacy of his blood, and the fruit of that redemption which he hath wrought: But oh how admirable and glorious ſhall he then appear, when they ſhall enjoy the fulneſs of his redemption in an unchangeable ſtate of bleſſedneſs for evermore?</p>
               <p n="4">IV. That he may have everlaſting objects of his love, to whom he may communicate his goodneſs, ſweetneſs, fulneſs; whom he may enrich with the treaſures of his Kingdom, feaſt with his love, beautifie with his ſalvation, and adorn with the brightneſs of his glory for ever: and this is that wherein the infinite goodneſs of God delighteth, even to give forth and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it ſelf: ſuch is his bleſſedneſs and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection that it is beyond all poſſibility of addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he can receive nothing from any, but
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:52862:180"/> delighteth to give and communicate: and as he is an everlaſting fountain of bleſſedneſs, ſo he will have everlaſting veſſels of honour into whom fulneſs of bleſſedneſs may ſtream and flow from himſelf for ever; that we may ſee our debt of love to Chriſt is eternal. O how many thouſand talents are we owing to Chriſt, and the longer the Saints enjoy the glory of Heaven through millions of ages, their debt to the Lamb that ſitteth on the throne will be the greater: eternal praiſes can take down nothing of it.</p>
               <p n="5">V. God will have ſome everlaſtingly to praiſe and glorifie his name, a conſort of Saints, his redeemed ones to joyn with his elect Angels in magnifying his name, exalting his praiſe, and doing him honour to all eternity. Ranſomed ones ſhall ſing the Goſpel-Song, <hi>Worthy is the Lamb,</hi> &amp;c. The Goſpel-Tune of the Song of free grace ſhall be for ever ſung in that bleſſed Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the firſt born, whoſe names are now written in Heaven.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. He will make his Saints everlaſtingly bleſſed, even for the Angels ſake, who perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in their integrity and obedience from the firſt moment of their creation until now, that their joy may be full. This may be collected by way of analogy and proportion from that ſpeech of Chriſt. <hi>I ſay unto you, that joy ſhall be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over one ſinner that repenteth,</hi> Luk. 15.7, 10. and again, <hi>there is joy in the preſence of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels over one ſinner that repenteth.</hi> If the Angels
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:52862:180"/> do now rejoyce to ſee their loſs in part repaired, and that (inſtead of their fellow Angels that fell, revolting from God and forſaking them, and now fighting againſt God, and oppoſing them in that Miniſtery wherein they ſerve him) ſome of man kind are turn'd unto God by unfeigned repentance, and joyned in communion with them (according to that of <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.22. which is ſpoken to the faithful: <hi>ye are come to an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable company of Angels</hi>) I ſay, if the Angels rejoyce in this, how ſhall their joy be filled up, to ſee many thouſands of the children of <hi>Adam</hi> tranſlated to Heaven, and confirmed in the full poſſeſſion of everlaſting glory and happineſs?</p>
               <p>This being a principal adjunct and qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that bleſſedneſs and ſalvation, which Chriſt hath purchaſed for his people, it may ſerve to rouze up thoſe, whoſe hearts and thoughts are chiefly taken up with ſuch tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things as are periſhing, and of a very ſhort continuance. S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s practice was quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. <hi>We look not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>at the things which are ſeen, which are temporal, but at the things which are not ſeen, which are eternal.</hi> Oh that we could be ſenſible of this extream folly, and learn ſeriouſly to conſider, what it is for an immortal ſoul, that muſt have an everlaſting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſubſiſtence, chiefly to mind, take care for, and ſtrive for things that laſt but a ſhort time, when it hath the offer of things eternal; to ſurfeit on momentany delights, and neglect eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:52862:181"/> fulneſs of joy; to ſeek greedily after uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and periſhing riches, and to neglect the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of eternity; to affect vain applauſe from the ſhort breath of dying men, and never labour to make ſure of everlaſting glory; to ſtrive to get the friendſhip of great men, carnal perſons, and neglect to have the eternal love of God aſſured to them, not labouring to enjoy God for ever. This may be much aggravated, if we take in conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> that the loſs of everlaſting ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for the gaining of temporal things, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with everlaſting miſery and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Is not this then extream folly to forfeit Heaven for Earth, and not onely to loſe ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſalvation for earthly things, but alſo to bring upon themſelves everlaſting miſery and deſtruction?</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. HAving ſpoken of the Circumſtances, ſubſtance, and adjuncts of the Saints glory, it will now be neceſſary that I make ſome uſe and improvement of what hath been ſpoken.</p>
               <p>Will God crown his people with glory, and is there ſuch a bleſſed eſtate reſerved in Heaven for them, as I have ſhewed at large? This then
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:52862:181"/> in the firſt place may inform us concerning the certainty of the ſalvation of the Saints. The ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of God's Children is ſo certain, that the Scripture ſpeaks not of it as if it were to come, but as if it were already paſt or preſent, even as if it were now done, and not as of a thing to be done: it is uſual in Scripture to deſcribe thoſe things which God hath certainly determined, in ſuch a manner as if they were certainly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed: So S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the ſalvation of the Saints, ſaith, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. <hi>according to his mercy he hath ſaved us:</hi> not he will do it, but he hath done it. <hi>By grace ye are ſaved,</hi> Eph. 2.8. not ye ſhall be, but ye are; whom he hath called, them hath he juſtified; and whom he hath juſtified, them alſo hath he glorified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that endureth temptation, for when he is tryed, he ſhall receive the crown of life,</hi> Jam. 1.12. From the certainty of future happineſs, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle inferreth and concludeth preſent bleſſedneſs; he ſhall be bleſſed, therefore he is bleſſed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſalvation of the Saints is certain if they look to God, or to themſelves; to God both in reſpect of his own purpoſe, and of Chriſt's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. God hath purpoſed it, therefore it ſhall inevitably come to paſs; all the powers on Earth or Hell ſhall never be able to divert it: Man's purpoſes are ſubject to alteration, God's are not. <hi>Balaam</hi> himſelf could ſay, <hi>where he bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, none can curſe,</hi> Numb. 23.23. if God hath ſaid it, he will do it; if he hath ſpoken it, he
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:52862:182"/> will certainly perform it — Certain it is alſo in reſpect of Chriſt's performance, Chriſt hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed all that is neceſſary and ſufficient for our ſalvation; he hath been both our ranſome and our purchaſe; ranſomed us from Hell, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for us an inheritance in Heaven. He is called <hi>the Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the world,</hi> Rev. 13.8. for, if ye look to the decree and purpoſe of God, he was ſo; or if ye look to the merit and efficacy of his ſufferings, he was ſo: To all the faithful that have lived, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, the ſuffering and ſacrifice of Chriſt is meritorious, and available, even to them that lived before Chriſt came into the fleſh, as well as to us that live after it: as many as are ſaved, are ſaved by it, as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> wittily ſpeaketh, <hi>Mors Chriſti proſuit, antequam fuit:</hi> the death of Chriſt was profitable, before it was.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſalvation of the Saints is certain alſo if they look to themſelves, if they look to what they are, <hi>aut re, aut ſpe,</hi> either indeed, or in hope; that is, either to their preſent eſtate, or their future.</p>
               <p>As to their preſent eſtate, God hath already ſo far given it them, as he hath certainly given the ſeal and earneſt of it to them; they have his Spirit already, that is the ſeal of their adoption, the earneſt of their ſalvation; and having this, they are ſure of the other, as when a man hath his earneſt, he is ſure of his bargain; and God never
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:52862:182"/> takes this earneſt back again, becauſe it is ſo the earneſt of our inheritance,<note place="margin">Praeſentia &amp; quae j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And as in reſpect of their preſent eſtate, ſo in reſpect of their future hope, as well as their preſent earneſt:<note place="margin">Futura ſperant, quicunque ſperant. <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
                  </note> their hope of ſalvation confirmeth their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.24. <hi>Ye are ſaved by hope,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: though hope be properly of future things, yet he ſpeaks of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation as of a thing preſent. Indeed it is not with this hope as with worldly hope: worldly hope doth many times fail a man, but this doth never; therefore it is called <hi>an anchor,</hi> Hebr. 6.19. <hi>which hope we have,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, as an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor of the ſoul, ſure and ſtedfaſt. <hi>Non dixit fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentum, ſed anchoram;</hi> he did not ſay a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, but an anchor, ſaith <hi>Chryſostom:</hi> foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:52862:183"/> are many times ſo firm, as that they are without any ſhaking or tottering at all, but it is not with a Ship lying at anchor, as with an houſe built upon a foundation: a Ship when it lyeth at anchor in the Sea, <hi>&amp; movetur, &amp; non movetur,</hi> it is moved, and not moved; it is moved as the winds ſtir it, but not moved from the place where the anchor holds it. Thus it is with the Chriſtian that lies floating in the Sea of this world, and yet hath caſt anchor in Heaven, <hi>&amp; movetur, &amp; non movetur,</hi> he may be both moved and not moved; for he ſtands not like a foundation that cannot be moved: the ſtreams of temptation and trouble will agitate and toſs him (<hi>O thou afflicted, and toſſed with tempests, Iſa.</hi> 54.11.) yet not moved, that he cometh in danger of being utterly overwhelmed, for hope is an anchor ſure and ſtedfaſt, that fixeth and ſetleth him. Where there is ſtedfaſtneſs of hope, there is aſſuredneſs of ſalvation: and that hope may be the anchor of the Soul, ſaith muſt go before to ſound the ground, or hope cannot do its office; for what more abſurd, than that hope ſhould have any certainty at all without faith, any more than an anchor ſhould have any ſtay without ground to faſten upon? this hope (as <hi>Hilary</hi> noteth) is not a preſuming of things uncertain, but an expectation of things known to us: for that cauſe it is, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hope maketh not aſhamed.</hi> They that hope, ſaith <hi>Theodoret,</hi> and are deceived of their hope, do
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:52862:183"/> bluſh, and are aſhamed thereof; now ſaith S. <hi>August.</hi> we are certain of our hope, for our hope is not uncertain, that we ſhould doubt thereof; yea, we are ſo certain thereof, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>We rejoyce under the hope of the glory of God,</hi> Rom. 5.2. which confidence and rejoycing of hope groweth from that which the Holy Ghoſt termeth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, full aſſurance of faith: that which the Saints hope for, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but come to paſs, the Spirit of God would never work this undoubted perſwaſion in their hearts, if he did not intend their eternal good; the promiſes of God are ſure grounds to caſt the anchor of our hope upon, they are the pillars of hope. <hi>David</hi> ſaith often in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. that he hoped in God's Word.</p>

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:52862:184"/> when they have all done, they ſhall not ſhut up Heaven againſt us, we ſhall have our reward there for all that; there we ſhall receive the crown of glory: there are two reaſons why they cannot deprive us of that crown.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That which cannot <hi>animam laedere,</hi> cannot <hi>caelo privare,</hi> that which cannot hurt the ſoul, cannot deprive him of Heaven; I have Heaven ſure as long as I have my ſoul ſafe: but no affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions can do that; they cannot prejudice or hurt the ſoul, not endanger the ſafety of it, nor come neer the life of it; all the hurt they can do, is but to the body onely, ſo far they can reach and no farther. Our Saviour gives us that comfort, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.4. <hi>Be not afraid of them,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that can kill the body; and when they have done ſo, there is no more that they can do:</hi> indeed that's a comfort worth a thinking on, that whoſoever our Enemies be, or whatever our afflictions be, they can onely reach to the hurting of the body, <hi>but there's no more that they can do:</hi> it is a ſtrange barbarouſneſs of nature that ſome Tyrants will ſhew, when they have killed and Martyred the poor Saints of God, as if that were too little to ſatisfie their rage, and that the fire of it could not be ſufficiently quenched with their blood; they'l take pleaſure to exerciſe fury upon their dead bodies, mangle them, hew them, and tread them under their feet; yea, ſometimes take them out of their graves, when they have been buried, as in the time of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> thoſe

               <p n="2">2.

<pb n="346" facs="tcp:52862:185"/> Rom.</hi> 8.35. <hi>What ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt?</hi> There be three things to be noted in that challenge. 1. That the godly are ſubject to all thoſe evils that the Apoſtle there reckons up; he reckons up ſeven in all; and ſtill that which cometh after, aggravateth that which went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <hi>Tribulation</hi> or trouble, that's the firſt: but to be in trouble and in <hi>anguiſh</hi> too; in anguiſh to be driven into <hi>perſecution</hi> and <hi>baniſhment;</hi> in baniſhment to ſuffer <hi>hunger</hi> and <hi>nakedneſs;</hi> with theſe to be in continual <hi>peril</hi> and danger: after all, to dye violently by the <hi>ſword:</hi> theſe are great evils all of them, and all of them exceeding one another, and yet it is certain, the godly are ſubject to all of them. 2. That in theſe evils the main end that the Devil aims at, is to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate God from us, and us from God; as may plainly be ſeen in <hi>Job</hi>'s caſe, where the Devil laid all the load he could upon him, and all to ſet God and him at variance, to make him to blaſpheme God, and God to forſake him. 3. That yet the anchor of our ſafety is ſo firmly caſt, as that no ſuch tempeſts as theſe ſhall ever cauſe ſuch a Shipwrack: in vain ſhall the Devil ever labour by any of theſe cords to pull God and us aſunder; they ſhall not make the faithful for their parts to ſhrink any whit from him; nay they will rather ſtick the cloſer to him: as wind puts not out the fire, but rather kindleth it; ſo that ſame wind of affliction which is ſent out to blow upon them, it ſhall not be a means to put out, but rather to
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:52862:185"/> kindle the fire of their love. God on the other ſide for his part will never the ſooner forſake them; nay, he is ſo far from forſaking his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in afflictions, as he doth then draw the nearer to them. Perhaps they are not alwayes ſo ſenſible of his preſence, but afraid that he hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his face away; yet certain it is, he is then ever at hand, and near unto them, ready to do by them, as Chriſt did by <hi>Peter</hi> in the ſtorm; as ſoon as they begin to ſink, to put his hand under them, and to ſave them from drowning. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, God hath compaſſion on us as a Father hath compaſſion on his Children; now Fathers have moſt compaſſion on their Children when they ſee them in moſt trouble and diſtreſs; if natural Fathers have ſo, God our Heavenly Father can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not then be void of the bowels of affection, when he ſeeth us in affliction and diſtreſs; God doth then pity us, and thoſe are infallible arguments of his love toward us: now if troubles and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions cannot ſeparate God's love from us, ſure they cannot ſhut up God's Kingdom againſt us, but notwithſtanding all the hardſhips they make us to ſuffer for the time, yet when we have been tryed, we ſhall receive the crown of life.</p>

               <p>A Twofold uſe may be made of what was laid down in the precedent Chapter; and it concerns them that are in affliction, and them that are not: for them that are in affliction, a cordial of unſpeakable comfort: for what can more comfort an afflicted ſoul when he ſeeth how all earthly joyes have forſaken him, and that he is every day fain to eat the bread of ſorrow, and to mingle his drink with tears, what can more comfort him than to know and to be aſſured, that yet for all this, he is never the farther from God, never the farther from Heaven: the world powreth contempt upon him, but God hath not caſt him out of his favour: his outward man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure is weakened and decayed, but his inner man is ſafe and untouch'd: Earth hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed him peace and comfort, but in Heaven there's laid up for him a crown of bleſſedneſs.</p>
               <p>This was it that gave <hi>Job</hi> comfort, and made him <hi>Victor in ſtercore,</hi> made him ſing Songs of Triumph, even when he was ſitting on the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill; his ſubſtance was gone, his Children were ſlain, his Wife tempted him, his Servants ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, his enemies inſulted on him, his Friends forſook him, the Devil was a ſcourge to him, God
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:52862:186"/> himſelf ſeemed to hide his face from him, yet for all this, ſaith he, <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that I ſhall ſee him at the laſt day:</hi> there is no comfort in the world comparable to this; ſo we may be ſure to come to Heaven at the laſt, no matter though we go thither in a a whirlwind and a fire; no matter whether a ſmooth way or a rugged: Better go a fowl way to a Banquet, than a fair way to a Gibbet. The reward we look for in Heaven is ſometime compared to a reaping, to a harveſt; now you know when the corn is ſown once, before we come to reap it, it ſuffers a great deal of hard weather; many daſhing rains, many nipping froſts, many biting winds, yet none of all theſe do hinder the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, they make the corn never the worſe either for ripening or reaping: in due ſeaſon we ſhall reap, as the Apoſtle ſaith, notwithſtanding all theſe. Afflictions are to us while we are living in the world, as hard weather to the corn while it is growing in the field: they nip us, they pinch us, they blow cold, they beat hard upon us, yet they ſhall not ſpoil us of the harveſt we look for, they ſhall not bereave us of the leaſt of thoſe ſheaves of joy that lye a ripening for us, but in due ſeaſon we ſhall reap the full crop into our garners: let this then be a cordial to all that are in affliction.</p>
               <p>Let it be alſo a preparative for thoſe that are not: prepare your ſelves O Chriſtians for the patient bearing of all trials that God ſhall ſend
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:52862:187"/> upon you, by laying up before hand this comfort and aſſurance, that no trials ſhall rob you of your crown.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Peradventure you will object, that yet they have done ſo by ſome— extremity of affliction hath driven them into extremity of deſpair; ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of receiving the Crown of life, they have cauſed their portion in the ſecond death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> Affliction hath not cauſed this, but the ill uſe that hath been made of affliction: we are to judge of affliction as we are to judge of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: they are either of them good or evil ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the good or evil uſe that is made of them: it's certain, that ſome that are in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſhall come to Heaven, yet their proſperity is not the cauſe of it; and ſo for ſome that are in affliction, 'tis poſſible for them to miſs of Heaven, yet 'tis not their affliction that deprives them of it: the good or evil uſe of either, is that which makes all of us in either to be happy or unhappy.</p>
               <p>Let it therefore prepare us for the conſtant and patient bearing of afflictions, whenſoever they ſhall come upon us, eſpecially if they ſhall come upon us for the teſtimony of the Goſpel, and for righteouſneſs ſake; for if the crown of glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to any that ſuffer, then certainly to thoſe ſufferers that our Saviour ſpeaks of, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.10. Thoſe that ſuffer for righteouſneſs ſake, they of all other are bleſſed, and to them belongeth the Kingdom of Heaven: yea, if in Heaven there be degrees of glory (as we may perſwade our ſelves
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:52862:187"/> there be) we may withall perſwade our ſelves that the chiefeſt manſions are for ſuch: they that moſt partake with Chriſt in his ſufferings, they ſhall moſt ſhare with him in glory; the faire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXII.</hi> An Exhortation to Christians to believe the promiſe of God touching their ſalvation, and ſo to lay claim to it.</head>
               <p n="1">1. NOw ſeeing God will hereafter crown his people with glory, then labour, O Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Reader, in the firſt place to believe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God touching the ſalvation of thy ſoul; labour to have a full aſſurance of faith, and a full affiance in God that he will ſave thee. A man takes it ill if he be not believed on his Word and promiſe, and ſo doth the faithful God, who is truth it ſelf, and cannot lye. The ſum of that which every faithful ſoul profeſſeth to believe in the Creed, is as much as if he ſhould ſay, I believe
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:52862:188"/> that God is my God and Father by the mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, through the ſanctification of the Holy-ghoſt, whereby he hath made me a member of his Catholick Church, which is the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Society of his Saints, to which and to all the members thereof, and ſo namely to me, he will give remiſſion of ſins, and an happy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the body, to be partaker with the ſoul of life eternal. This was <hi>David</hi>'s faith; <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to ſee the goodneſs of God in the Land of the living,</hi> Pſal. 27.13. And <hi>Fulgentius</hi> ſaith, it was not proper onely to <hi>David</hi> to ſay ſo; for ſaith he, the juſt man living by faith, ſaith boldly, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to ſee the goodneſs of the Lord in the land of the living. S. <hi>August.</hi> ſpeaks well to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; God hath promiſed thee, O man, that thou ſhalt live for ever, doſt thou not believe it? that which he hath already done for thee, is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter matter than that which he hath promiſed thee.</p>
               <p>Therefore let us labour to get an aſſured truſt in God and his promiſe, that when he that is our life ſhall appear, we alſo may appear with him in glory: <hi>which glory</hi> though we know it not, yet we know that God hath given us the intereſt and title of it already, and by faith do ſtand aſſured through the Spirit, that he will in due time give us the full ſight and fruition of it, which none can know but they that have it revealed to them from God? but God revealeth it by the Holy Ghoſt to every one that believeth in his promiſe, and hopeth for his ſalvation: therefore
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:52862:189"/> let no faithful ſoul whom God hath called into Communion with himſelf, and to the hope of everlaſtingly life, ſtand any longer in doubt of that ſalvation which God hath promiſed him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When once thou doſt believe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God touching the ſalvation of thy ſoul, then mayeſt thou claim Heaven as thine own by a due debt: God hath made himſelf a debtor to his people by promiſe; faithful promiſe makes due debt; the debt in that caſe ariſeth not from any deſert of him to whom the promiſe is made, but only the word of him that promiſeth. We muſt therefore diſtinguiſh between debt of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, and debt of promiſe; for debt of deſert ariſeth out of the nature and condition of the work it ſelf, which obligeth him to whoſe uſe and ſervice it is done; but debt of promiſe ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not from the thing that is done, or yielded to another, but onely from the promiſe it ſelf, whereby a man hath bound himſelf. As <hi>August.</hi> well obſerveth, that it is one thing to ſay to a man, Thou art a debtor to me, becauſe I have given to thee; another thing to ſay, Thou art a debtor to me, becauſe thou haſt promiſed me: debt of promiſe moveth the promiſer for his own ſake, though there be nothing in the party to whom he hath made promiſe, that may excite or cauſe him to perform his promiſe. Now it is an act of juſtice in God to perform his promiſe made to his Children to bring them to Heaven, and to beſtow eternal life upon them, for it is the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:52862:189"/> juſtice of God that what is promiſed be paid or performed: hereupon ſaith <hi>Auguſt.</hi> we ſay not unto God, Repay that which thou haſt received, but pay that which thou haſt promiſed: let us hold him therefore a moſt faithful debtor, becauſe we have him a moſt merciful promiſer: the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was made in mercy, the performance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of dependeth upon the fidelity of the promiſer, not upon the merit of the worker; the promiſe is ſure, not according to our merits, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his mercy: therefore go to God and ſay, Lord thou haſt promiſed to beſtow the Crown of glory upon all that come unto thee, Lord we have thy word, there is a promiſe wherein thou haſt cauſed me to hope; Be it to thy ſervant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy Word.</p>

<pb n="356" facs="tcp:52862:190"/> what thou ſuffereſt, what thy actions or what thy ſufferings are, as what thy love to God is: ſo then the greateſt Saint is not barely he that hath done moſt, or ſuffered moſt, but he that loveth moſt, as it was ſaid of <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk</hi> 7.47.</note> that many ſins were forgiven her, becauſe ſhe loved much. If thou haſt true ſaith, it will be the fountain of thy love to God, who believing God to be ſuch, and ſo merciful to to thee, it ſwalloweth up thy affections, and draweth out thy love and devotion toward him; which is not unfelt in us; but by the feeling thereof in our ſelves, we gather a further confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and aſſurance to our ſelves, that we are beloved of God; both which S. <hi>Bernard</hi> well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, ſaying, that the love of God breedeth in the ſoul love toward God; and by feeling it ſelf to love, it is alſo out of doubt that it ſelf is beloved: now if thou art one that loveſt God, thou maiſt conclude thou art beloved of him (for we love him becauſe he loved us firſt) and therefore thou haſt an intereſt in the crown of life which God hath promiſed to them that love him.</p>
                  <p>True it is, ſometimes it is ſaid, it ſhall be given to ſuch as the Lord loveth; his love to us, that is it that ſhall ſet this glorious crown upon our heads. The Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.4. ſpeaking both of our Sanctification and Salvation, makes God the Author of them both: and in God, the cauſe of both, the riches of his mercy, and the greatneſs of his love. <hi>God who is rich in mercy, through his
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:52862:190"/> great love wherewith he hath loved us, hath raiſed us up together, and made us to fit together in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly places.</hi> So S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, it was God's love to us, that he ſent his onely Son to us, in him to give us life and ſalvation: herein was the great love of God manifeſted towards us, in that God ſent his onely begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.9. Yet S. <hi>James</hi> tells us, the crown of life ſhall be given to them that love the Lord: as if it were not ſo much his love to us as did graciouſly vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe it, as our love to him that did deſervedly merit it. But theſe may both ſtand together; the promiſe of eternal life may be ſaid to belong both to thoſe whom the Lord loveth, and to thoſe that love the Lord: for firſt, this love of God to us and our love to him, do alwayes go together, like fountain and ſtream, ſeed and fruit, fire and light, cauſe and effect: whenſoever his love takes hold upon us, it generates and begets in us love toward him again. We read of <hi>Solomon,</hi> that he was named <hi>Jedidjah,</hi> becauſe he was the beloved of the Lord, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.25. and we likewiſe read of him, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.3. that he loved the Lord: he was the beloved of the Lord, and he loved the Lord: God's love working upon him, it wrought in him again love toward God: now they that are beloved of God, and they that love God, they have both of them the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of eternal life. God's love to them is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the cauſe of it; their love to him, that's
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:52862:191"/> onely the Seal of it. What S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith of the love of our Brethren, the ſame may we ſay of the love of God. We know by it, that we are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated from death to life,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14.</note> which life is a token of aſſurance by which we know we ſhall be ſaved. The cauſe of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is in God's loving us; our loving of God is a token only, by which we know we are ſealed up unto ſalvation.</p>

She was to purifie her ſelf a whole year before ſhe could attain to be Queen, ſix months with oyl of Myrrh, and ſix moneths with ſweet Odours, then ſhe was brought to the King: ſhall an earthly Prince expect ſuch exact purification, before he will beſtow his honours? and ſhall not God expect our purifying our ſelves, before we come and ſit upon thrones of glory? can we think that God will cloath our Bodies of ſin with Robes of glory, and that God will put the pure white linnen of the Saints upon the ſtinking low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie rags of the old <hi>Adam?

                  <p>Go to now Brethren! ye that hope to be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with Chriſt; conſider with your ſelves, whether the old man be put off, whether your earthly members be mortified, or do you walk ſtill in the vanity of your minds, do you ſtill keep your former converſations? are your luſts your Centurions ſtill? do you obey them? then let me tell you, you have no part in Chriſt, you are not the Sons of God, your hopes of Heaven are but preſumptions, you are never like to ſee God in glory. See what you muſt expect, Coloſſ. 3.16. <hi>For which things ſake cometh the wrath of God upon the children of diſobedience.</hi> Tremble at it, ye that hope for glory, and yet go on in your ſins; your ſins will bring the wrath of God upon your ſouls, and not the glory of God; you are the children of diſobedience, and not the children of God: if you will maintain your hopes of glory and title to Heaven, ſhew it forth by purifying your ſelves as Chriſt is pure. Suppoſe a leper in times of legal pollutions ſhould have pronounced himſelf clean, while the leprouſie was upon him, yet he ſhould not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:52862:192"/> into the Camp, unleſs the Prieſt did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him clean: ſo may you ſay that you are clean, and that you ſhall be glorified, yet you ſhall never poſſeſs glory, unleſs Chriſt the High-Prieſt pronounce you clean.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXIV.</hi> Setteth forth the danger of thoſe that are in a ſtate of Damnation.</head>
               <p>THis in the next place may ſerve to awaken all ſlumbring ſpirits, and to ſtartle all thoſe that ſleep ſecurely in ſin, that are far from God, and nigh to deſtruction, and yet are well pleaſed with their condition, and are inſenſible of the danger they are in: if the Lord would now open their eyes as he did the eyes of the Hoſt of the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> they would ſee they were in the midſt of <hi>Samaria,</hi> in the midſt of Enemies, in the way to deſtruction, that their judgment lingers not, their damnation ſlumbers not; on the one ſide they are haſtening toward deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and on the other ſide deſtruction is haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning toward them: Oh how woful is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch men! who can dwell with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring fire? who can endure everlaſting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? Secure Sinners! ye are almoſt in the mouth of Death, and in the gate of Hell; and the longer you continue in the way you are in, the farther
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:52862:193"/> you are from God, and the nearer to ruine; you are very near to hell and condemnation, upon the very brink and border of the land of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: it is ſaid of the watered ground that bringeth forth nothing but briars and thorns, that is rejected, that it is nigh to curſing, whoſe end is to be burnt, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.8. Salvation is far from the wicked, and deſtruction is near them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.150. If a man had a dwelling near the gate of hell, within the hearing of the hideous cry and noiſe of thoſe loſt ſouls and damned ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, could he ſleep quietly, could he take any content in meat or drink, or any thing elſe? they that are far from God are near to the pit of deſtruction, and this is their miſery that they know it not. Is it not a madneſs for a man to be at his ſports and paſtimes, when his houſe is on fire, and all that he hath is burning to aſhes? and is it not a far greater madneſs for you O ſinners to ſport your ſelves with ſin, while the flames of Hell fire are ready to ſeize upon you? Oh have pity and compaſſion on your own ſouls; you would pity a Beaſt if you ſhould ſee him ready to break his neck down a rock, and will you have no pity on your own ſouls that are now ready to be ſwallowed up in the gulf of hell?</p>
               <p>Conſider, I pray you, that to enjoy the Word of Chriſt, and to hear it powerfully Preached, and yet not to be effectually converted by it, it brings not a man one ſtep nearer Heaven, and puts him not an inch farther from hell than he
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:52862:193"/> was before. It is ſaid, <hi>Jude</hi> verſ. 5. <hi>that the Lord having ſaved the people of Iſrael out of the land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>afterward deſtroyed them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not:</hi> there was a land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> a land of promiſe, and of reſt offered to them, and the Lord had made way for them to enter in and poſſeſs it; he had ſaved them out of the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and brought them near the borders of <hi>Canaan;</hi> but this did no whit avail thoſe among them that were unbelieving and diſobedient; they were deſtroyed, their Carcaſſes fell in the wilderneſs, they periſhed in their ſins: this I take to be a Type of the condition of ſecure, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, impenitent perſons under the Goſpel: there is ſalvation wrought; Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave; a way is open to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Canaan,</hi> to that eternal reſt prepared for the people of God: the fiery pillar, the light of the Goſpel is in ſight, ſhewing the way to the Kingdom of Heaven; but when men and women do careleſly neglect it, this their condition is worſe than if there had never been any poſſibility of ſalvation; Better it had been they had died in <hi>Egypt,</hi> than at the borders of <hi>Canaan:</hi> better, never in any degree to be ſaved, than to be once ſaved, and afterward to be deſtroyed; utter deſtruction after ſome beginnings of ſalvation, is worſe than no kind of ſalvation at all; therefore in the 12 <hi>verſe</hi> of that ſame Epiſtle of <hi>Jude,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>they are trees whoſe fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots.</hi> I entreat
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:52862:194"/> you ſeriouſly to conſider the woful eſtate of a ſoul twice dead, twice loſt, twice condemned; once condemned by the Law, and then again condemned by the Goſpel; Oh tremble and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of this double condemnation. If the river of brimſtone enkindled by the Law be ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.14. Oh how dreadful then ſhall thoſe flames of wrath be, if they ſhall be fed and increaſed with the oyl of the Goſpel, for the neglect and contempt of ſalvation wrought by Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Oh how do multitudes of men that are now under the ſound of the Goſpel, and have the means of ſalvation afforded them, put away the word of life from them, and judge themſelves unworthy of everlaſting life! ſuch will one day (when it is too late) ſee their folly, and wiſh they had never had a Chriſt nor a Goſpel, nor a Heaven, nor an immortal ſoul to loſe. The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Hiſtory reporteth of <hi>Bajazet</hi> the Fourth, King of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who hearing that <hi>Tamerlane</hi> had taken his City <hi>Sebastia,</hi> and there ſlain his eldeſt Son <hi>Orthobules,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Knoll</hi>'s Turkiſh Hiſtory on <hi>Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet</hi> 4th.</note> he was ſo much grieved at it, that marching with his great Army againſt <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> and by the way hearing a Countrey Shepheard merrily repoſing himſelf with his homely Pipe, as he ſate upon the ſide of a mountain feeding his poor flock, ſtanding ſtill a great while liſtening unto him, to the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of many, at laſt fetching a deep ſigh brake
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:52862:194"/> forth into theſe words, <hi>O happy Shepheard, which hadst neither</hi> Orthobules <hi>nor</hi> Sebaſtia <hi>to loſe!</hi> This will be all the comfort that the deſpiſers of the Word, and the rejecters of everlaſting life, ſo freely tendered in the Goſpel, ſhall have at the laſt day, when in the anguiſh and bitterneſs of their ſouls they ſhall cry out; happy are ye dark mountains on whom the Sun of righteouſneſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhined, happy ye dry and barren deſerts that were never refreſhed with ſpiritual dew, nor watered with the rain of Heavenly doctrine, who had never any <hi>Moſes</hi> to drop doctrine upon you, no <hi>Paul</hi> to plant, no <hi>Apollo</hi> to water you with the word; happy ye benighted Gentiles who never had any Goſpel, nor a Chriſt, nor a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven to loſe by your Rebellion againſt Chriſt: this will be all the comfort ſuch ſouls will have for all the priviledges they have had beyond others, and all the opportunities they have loſt: it is an honour here to enjoy God's Oracles, and to be under the call of the Goſpel: but to have the word of Grace and means of Salvation, and not to bring forth fruit thereby to everlaſting life, it will turn to their greater confuſion in another world.</p>

               <p>THeſe things being ſo; how ſhould the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration hereof ſtir up to labour after eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life and bleſſedneſs: eternal life is the ſtipend of our warfare, the hire and wages of our works; God hath not appointed Heaven for idle Droans and Loiterers, but for ſuch as labour for it; Heaven is a Crown or Garland, win it and wear it; it is an Harveſt, labour for it, if thou wilt enjoy it; it is a Field of Treaſure, thou muſt purchaſe it, if thou wilt poſſeſs it: it is a ſtrong City, and muſt be taken by force and violence. S. <hi>Bernard</hi> hath this diviſion, <hi>Alii mercantur, alii furantur,</hi> &amp;c. Some do Merchandize for Heaven, and they are ſuch as make friends with the Mammon of unrighteouſneſs; others do ſteal Heaven, and they are like the Woman that was healed by the ſecret touch of our Saviours gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: many invade Heaven, and take it by force, (for indeed the Kingdom of Heaven ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth violence) and they may be compared to <hi>Jacob</hi> that ſtrove with God, wreſtled with the Angel and prevailed; but none of theſe ſhall merit eternal life hereby: but life eternal ſhall be the conſequent of a Holy life, and the reward of their labour that ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:52862:195"/> gate; God having ſo ordained the one to be the way whereby he will bring us to the other.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>I have fought the good fight, I have kept the faith, I have finiſhed my courſe, henceforth is laid up for me a Crown of righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. where obſerve, 1. He acted like a mighty man of war, fighting valiantly againſt all the enemies of his Salvation, both within and without, that went about to hinder him from getting the crown. 2. He finiſhed his courſe, he ran with all his might, he put forth himſelf to the uttermoſt, that ſo he might finiſh his courſe. 3. He kept the faith, he would not ſuffer men or Devils to rob him of this precious jewel; and he was ſure to ſpeed, here was his confidence, <hi>henceforth,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is laid up for me a Crown of righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iren.</hi> lib. 4. c. 27.</note> Now ſaith <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> the good combatant exhorteth us to the combat of immortality, that we may be crowned, and may think the crown precious, as being obtained by ſight, and not of it ſelf accrewing to us: and by how much the more it cometh by fight, ſo much the more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious it is; and the more precious it is, ſo much the more we may love it, and ought ſo much the more to labour after it. <hi>So run that you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.24. He that runs for a prize runs with all his might, he runs himſelf all over in a ſweat: <hi>I run,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, not as uncertainly; ſo fight I, not as beating the air;</hi> he ran, but not
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:52862:196"/> as ſome do, in a cold and negligent way, not knowing whether he ſhould come to the end of the race or not, but with all earneſtneſs, as one that was reſolved to finiſh his courſe. A Soldier that fighteth in the Wars, fighteth with violence, he fighteth for life and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour both; ſo much more one that fighteth the good fight, even for eternal life and glory: a Soldier that fighteth in the War, fighteth to ſave his own life, and for glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides; ſo a Soldier of Jeſus Chriſt fighteth to ſave his life from eternal ruine, and to gain eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal glory. Some of God's Children are ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that the world looks upon them as mad men; they may think them out of their wits, but, they may anſwer with <hi>Paul, If we are beſide our ſelves it is for God</hi> and Chriſt, it is for Heaven and everlaſting Salvation. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle thus exhorts the <hi>Philippians, Work out your own ſalvation,</hi> Phil. 2.12. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, break out thorow all difficulties, work out, work thorow all, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.11, 12. <hi>What manner of perſons ought ye to be in all holy converſation and godlineſs, looking for, and hastening to the coming of the day of God?</hi> as if he had ſaid, I am not able to expreſs, what manner of perſons ſuch ought to be, what exactneſs is required of thoſe that will be ſaved, how they ought to walk in all holy converſation and godlineſs, as perſons that are in haſt to meet with Chriſt, and have no leiſure to turn out
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:52862:196"/> of the way of holineſs, into crooked paths with the workers of iniquity.</p>
               <p>Things of the greateſt worth are uſually accompanied with the greateſt difficulty, and are hardeſt to be gained; ſo it is in the things of the world; the greater worldly deſigns men do purſue, the more pains it coſts them to attain their end; high honour, and a great eſtate is not gotten without much ſweat, and great endeavours; much more when a ſoul will get an incorruptible crown, what holy contention is required in this caſe? Though it be moſt true, that the Prince and Captain of our ſalvation hath already overcome the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt difficulty of all, without which it had not been poſſible for any of the Children of <hi>Adam</hi> to have come to glory, yet he will have his children conformed to himſelf in going through many difficulties unto glory. Moreover, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enemies do beſet the way unto, and entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven; Principalities and Powers, the Rulers of the darkneſs of this world, and ſpiritual wickedneſſes in high (or heavenly) places, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12. now ſmall forces in a narrow way are able to keep back a great Army for a long time; now theſe ſtrong and mighty enemies muſt be removed by violence, or elſe there is no paſſing: Oh what neceſſity is there now required to break thorow all theſe, and in the power of Chriſt to tread the Devil and all his Angels under our feet, if
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:52862:197"/> we will enter in at the ſtrait gate; to march on, though never ſo many forces of the world, and Legions of Hell ſhould ſtand in the way; to contend mightily, as knowing there is no middle condition between everlaſting death and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, that we muſt overcome or periſh.</p>
               <p>How vigorouſly and vehemently doth the Apoſtle preſs this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.13. <hi>Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit your ſelves like men,</hi>
